My wife, on the other hand, is working in the mental health sector and is the proper definition of a risk averse person. If you talk to her about stocks, she will talk to you about the 1929 crash.

The thing is that her salary is substantial and she is doing nothing with it. She is frugal but all her savings go to the bank and sit there.

I tried to convince her to invest part of it but a little voice in my head tells me that it's not a good idea (even with an important bond allocation). When the market will do a downturn, I will have to explain that it's normal and that it's a buying opportunity.

So what would you do ? It's frustrating to know that this cash is sitting there and losing value with inflation. 

Something I thought about was to make her buy bonds and I would increase my stocks allocation but again, not sure that's a good idea.

EDIT: thank you all for your stories and your advices. I wasn't expecting that much! To answer a question that was raised and that could explain her position, someone in her family had gambling issues and that explains why she's so afraid of ""losing it all"". I think a good way to make her invest more is increase her percentage in our mortgage (we plan to buy). That way she invests in something that she considers as secure and less volatile that the stock market. And in parallel, I would start by making her invest in a HYSA, then Ibonds and finally in a BND portfolio where I would increase the stock allocation year after year.

zpdsvz,zeppo_shemp,John Bogle sold most of his stocks in 2000 because valuations were high and he thought bonds would beat stocks over the next decade.,"the more I look on reddit, the more I believe most self-proclaimed Bogleheads are not very familiar with what John Bogle actually said. I get the impression people are taking advice from the reddit consensus, or from Taylor Larrimore's books which are very simplified compared to Bogle's books. it might be time for people to go back to the source on Bogle-related info. 

a few months ago, I posted a reminder here that Bogle recommended a minimum 20% bond allocation for all investors (see the asset allocation chapters in *The Common Sense Book of Investing Advice*). yet I constantly see self-proclaimed Bogleheads saying 'you don't need bonds until you're older, or x-years from retirement'. 

came across another example recently. In a 2014 interview (here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ra5POdsYg ) Bogle explained how he sold most of his stocks during the dot-com bubble that peaked in 2000. He had a 70-80% stocks allocation, and went down to 25-30% (3:40). Why? Because stocks had highly elevated Shiller price to earnings ratio of 40 (this is the '40 times earnings' Bogle mentions at about 3:00). Based on that high valuation, Bogle expected the market would be basically flat over the next decade, as higher p/e ratio equals worse stock returns and lower p/e ratio equals better returns as he explains in *Common Sense*. He also noted that stocks had historically low dividend yields of 1%, while investment grade bonds had 7% yields and were likely to perform better than stocks over the next decade (ca. 2000 to 2010)

anyone who talks this way on reddit gets downvoted into oblivion by the Bogleheads. I've seen it happen. yet it's exactly in line with Bogle's principles as outlined in his books. 

in fact, bonds performed as well as stocks from 2000 to 2020, if not better! The New York Times reports the S&P 500 averaged 5.4%/year during that period, while and investment grade bond index returned 5.2%/yr, and other types of bonds (treasuries, high-yield debt) had even better annual returns. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html",676,0.92,167,Bogleheads,12/18/22 20:09,"the more i look on reddit, the more i believe most self-proclaimed bogleheads are not very familiar with what john bogle actually said. i get the impression people are taking advice from the reddit consensus, or from taylor larrimore's books which are very simplified compared to bogle's books. it might be time for people to go back to the source on bogle-related info.

vgl90x,yungunddumb,"Windfall of $5M, 31 years old, resigned last week to retire early. Need advice on portfolio-allocation for (very) early retirement (50 years+).","Hi guys,

Been on this subreddit for a while now. Made a throwaway account because i’d like to stay anonymous.

So I have received a windfall of $5M about 1 year ago (I’m 31 years old right now). Haven’t touched the money for a year, so I could research what to do with it.

**Conclusion of my research**: low fee broad-market index fund (for stocks and bonds).

Based on ERN’s research ([https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/)) I decided to go with a SWR of 3% in up markets and trim it down to 2.5% on down years (to lower sequence risk). Also, during a downturn I will withdraw from the bond allocation instead of equities (this will give me 10+ years of runtime before I have to sell equities). Will rebalance accordingly of course.

Also important to mention: I have a paid off house that is big enough for starting a family later on the road.

Because I live in Europe, most standard index funds are not available. I’ve chosen the following index funds:

\-EQUITIES = **VWCE** (Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF USD Acc) (ISIN: IE00BK5BQT80)

\-BONDS = **DBZB** (Xtrackers II Glbal Governmnt Bnd UCITS ETF 1C HEUR) (ISIN: LU0378818131)

**VWCE** because it’s accumulating and that gives me tax benefits. **DBZB** consist of globally diversified treasuries only because corporate bonds can be correlated with equities.

Based on my research I’m pretty sure my choice of index funds and SWR is solid. However, i’m not sure about the allocation. I was thinking of **70/30** or **60/40** or maybe even **50/50** (because some say why keep playing if you already won ?). All three the allocation have a 100% succes rate when using a 3% SWR according to ERN’s research. However, this is based on past performance.

Also to keep in mind: as the title says, at the moment I don’t have any income and i’m working on a side business of which I hope one day will give me some income. So for now I can be considered “retired”.

Thanks a lot!",191,0.9,93,Bogleheads,6/20/22 9:14,"hi guys,

A few highlights IMHO:

* ""So long as financial markets function as intended, policymakers are willing to accept asset price volatility and a deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals as a consequence of fighting inflation. ""
* ""Global conditions today and those anticipated in the coming months are similar to those that have signaled global recessions in the past."" ... ""Although all recessions are painful, this one is unlikely to be historic.""
* Vanguard's economic forecasts for GDP growth and headline inflation are more pessimistic than the consensus forecast (from the forecasts table).
* ""We now expect U.S. bonds to return 4.1%–5.1% per year over the next decade, compared with the 1.4%–2.4% annual returns we forecast a year ago.""
* ""From a U.S. dollar investor’s perspective, the VCMM projects higher 10-year annualized returns for non-U.S. developed markets (7.2%–9.2%) and emerging markets (7%–9%) than for U.S. markets (4.7%–6.7%).""",147,0.96,67,Bogleheads,11/24/22 8:47," vanguard economic and market outlook for 2023 posted on twitter yesterday:

16igt13,technogeek1995,WSJ Opinion: Indexing Is Still the Best Bet for Investors,"Pretty good opinion piece in this morning’s WSJ from Burton Malkiel, who wrote _A Random Walk Down Wallstreet_. He cites some research from Vanguard comparing the portfolio performance of index funds vs actively managed funds during a 20 year stretch covering the dot com bubble in the 1990s. His intent was to compare the inflated PEs of the dot com bubble with today’s AI hype.

> But did indexing really fail? The evidence suggests it didn’t. From 1990 to 2009, according to the Bogle Financial Research Center at Vanguard, a broad U.S. stock market index fund outperformed the average actively managed equity fund by almost 1% a year. The total stock market index returned 8.42% annually in that 20-year period, including both the dot-com bubble and the poor returns that followed. The realized annual return from the average actively managed equity mutual fund was only 7.53%. And the best 20 active funds of the 1990s underperformed the index by more than 3 percentage points a year in the first decade of the 2000s.

14bx69s,talamook,My disabled sister lost $70k due to my recommendation to invest in 3 Vanguard index funds," **TL;DR**  UPDATES AT BOTTOM

My sister recently became disabled.  She was a good saver and managed to save 600k by age 48. She believes the stock market is gambling.  I sat her down and explained that by not investing, she will most likely outlive her money because she is so young and disabled. I explained inflation will erode her savings. Her expenses are $45k/yr so she has 27.02 years until the money runs out (600k+1900/mo (ibond interest+ssdi)/45k=27.02 years). We went through firecalc and other monte carlo simulations which showed the possible outcomes based on different asset allocations.  I emphasized THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES, but asked her to think about investing.  This was in December 2021.

In late December she called and said she wants to begin her new investment journey at the beginning of the new year.  I said great.  In January 2022 She invested:

VTI - 240K     VXUS - 120K     BND - 240K

and...we all know what happened.  So we are going on 18 months now and she is down over 70k.  In October 2022 she was down over 120k and was calling me every day.  Keep in mind, this is someone who has never invested because the stock market is gambling as far as she is concerned.  It's hard for me to convince her otherwise at this point and I can't say that I blame her one bit.  To her credit, she has not sold anything, not 1 share.  Starting in January 2022 she has been using her SSDI + 60k emergency fund to pay her expenses.  She also has an ibond ladder in place and redeems 6k yearly in ibonds.   She will be selling her car soon ($30k) since she can no longer drive.  She will not start taking redemptions (drawing down) her portfolio until January 2026.

She does receive SSDI of $1400/mo but I did not factor this in to firecalc for 2 reasons.

1. She has to do SSDI reviews every 3 years and could lose her SSDI benefit.
2. Although helpful I don't count SSDI as a reliable income source.

I feel terrible.  I have offered to:

1. Have her sell everything and reimburse her the 70k losses.
2. Invest an additional 70k into her investment accounts to make up the loss.
3. Pay the expenses she can't cover once her emergency fund runs out.

She barely speaks to me at this point.

\*Thanks to everyone for all of the responses/suggestions/criticisms.  Please keep them coming.  At this point I am leaning towards making her whole for whatever losses she has incurred up to this point and she can cash out and then do whatever she would like.  This has been a (wonderful) learning experience so far.

UPDATE: 9/1/2023 - I have taken all of your wonderful suggestions and run them past my sister.  Currently we're in the ""Let's wait and see what happens"" (her words) phase.  Account Balance is 550K, down 5%. No shares have been sold.  Emergency fund balance was down to $21,150 from $60,000 as my sister has a $1,850 monthly shortfall in income currently and has been drawing on her EF to cover expenses since 01/2022, BUT she just SOLD HER CAR for 32k so it bumped her Emergency fund back up to $53,150.  This means she will have enough to cover her expenses with a little left over (+$3,200) in her EF when she starts making redemptions / drawing down her investment portfolio in Jan. 2026.

I am currently most focused on getting her yearly expenses reduced. I think I can get her expenses down to 38k/yr VS currently 45k/yr.  Just by selling her car she has eliminated the costs of insurance, registration, maint., etc.

Reflecting back on what has transpired, I did learn that had she DCA instead of LS the money, she would be up 64k instead of being down 50k.  What's done is done but it does sting a little knowing that she invested at the absolute tippy top of the last bull market..   ",462,0.86,484,Bogleheads,6/17/23 13:49," **tl;dr**  updates at bottom

my sister recently became disabled.  she was a good saver and managed to save 600k by age 48. she believes the stock market is gambling.  i sat her down and explained that by not investing, she will most likely outlive her money because she is so young and disabled. i explained inflation will erode her savings. her expenses are $45k/yr so she has 27.02 years until the money runs out (600k+1900/mo (ibond interest+ssdi)/45k=27.02 years). we went through firecalc and other monte carlo simulations which showed the possible outcomes based on different asset allocations.  i emphasized there are no guarantees, but asked her to think about investing.  this was in december 2021.

in late december she called and said she wants to begin her new investment journey at the beginning of the new year.  i said great.  in january 2022 she invested:

vti - 240k     vxus - 120k     bnd - 240k

and...we all know what happened.  so we are going on 18 months now and she is down over 70k.  in october 2022 she was down over 120k and was calling me every day.  keep in mind, this is someone who has never invested because the stock market is gambling as far as she is concerned.  it's hard for me to convince her otherwise at this point and i can't say that i blame her one bit.  to her credit, she has not sold anything, not 1 share.  starting in january 2022 she has been using her ssdi + 60k emergency fund to pay her expenses.  she also has an ibond ladder in place and redeems 6k yearly in ibonds.   she will be selling her car soon ($30k) since she can no longer drive.  she will not start taking redemptions (drawing down) her portfolio until january 2026.

she does receive ssdi of $1400/mo but i did not factor this in to firecalc for 2 reasons.

https://preview.redd.it/5wdgj6y0yev61.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=7518d92b90892727112c136cca4ddc20ca7319a2

From some of the questions I got, I thought it would helpful to share a handful of steps on how newer investors can set up an easy & super smart portfolio.

Many of us love to get into the weeds and spend endless hours thinking about tweaks that may or may not (equally likely) improve our returns by 1%, but **the goal of my recommendations here is to set up the optimal portfolio for someone who wants to invest wisely, but also doesn't want to spend more time than needed tinkering with it.**

Below I'll walk you through a few easy steps to set up a globally diversified, low cost portfolio with one single fund. It'll just take an hour or two and once you set it up and won't require any tinkering in the future. **Best of all, it'll put you in a position to outperform something in the ballpark of 80%+ of all other investors after accounting for fees.**

This isn't just my opinion. If ya look at the research, you'll find:

1. Low fee index funds beat actively managed mutual funds a majority of the time on an after-fee basis
2. A vast majority of active traders underperform
3. No one has a clue which markets will outperform in the future and therefore diversification is a great way to go.

Historically, the market's returned 10%. Here's some motivation. **If you compound $100k at 10% over 30 years, you'll have $1.7M**. The magic of compounding.

A note on bonds:

**I'm just talking about stocks & money markets here but for many if not most investors bonds can still play a role.** They play an essential role for folks with shorter time horizons. 

Traditionally, the rule has been to subtract your age from the number 110, and that's the percentage of your investments you should have in stocks. So if you're 30, this rule would mean you have 80% in stocks and 20% in bonds. In today's interest rate environment, the rule should probably use the number 120 or 130. In addition to age, the other consideration is how soon you'll likely need the $ you're investing. If you don't have stable income, or you have health conditions that could result in unplanned medical bills, or you're planning to use the $ you're investing relatively soon, you should have a more conservative allocation.

As for which bonds, I'd suggest either BSV, a short term bond fund, or splitting your bonds 50/50 between BSV & BND. The combo means you have a total bond portfolio tilted towards short term bonds. Short duration bonds have the least interest rate/inflation risk which is what you need to look out for. If/when rates increase, which they're very likely to in the years ahead, bonds will depreciate. If we get bad inflation, that's kryptonite for bonds, especially long bonds.

A few examples. My parents are 70 and 2 years away from retirement. I have them in 45% bonds, 55% stocks. A decade ago I would've put them in 55% bonds. Their portfolio tilts towards short duration. My sister set up a college savings account for my 12 year old nephew. He's in something like 30% bonds now, and will shift a bit towards bonds as he approaches college age. I'm 32, healthy, and reliably employed. I don't have any bonds.

This wouldn't have been true a decade ago, but today, if you're under 40 and you're investing for the long term, I think you can get away without bonds. The prevailing industry view is probably that a 40 year old should have 30% in bonds. I think that's insane.

**How to set up a hands-off portfolio in 5 steps:**

1. **Decide how much to hold in cash.** Calculate how much $ you spend on monthly expenses. If you're healthy & have stable income, set aside $ to cover at least 3-6 months of expenses in a checking account. Now think about anything you know you'll wanna spend $ on in the next year (tuition, new car, etc). That's the bare minimum you should be in cash. No harm in adding an extra cushion, just keep in mind that ""investing in cash"" is a decision too. Choosing to be in cash locks you in to 2-3% depreciation per year (could become even worse with inflation). The value of cash halves every 16 or 17 years. (!) Stocks are volatile and can draw down as much as 30% in a bad year, but over the long term they've returned 10% per year, and most expect average returns of 7-8% per year going forward. Once you decide on an amount you always wanna have in cash, write the number down. You'll wanna remember it. Since I'm healthy/employed/youngish I'm pretty aggressive. I tend to have 3-4K in my checking account at all times, plus 3-4k in a money market fund sitting in my individual broker account (\~7k). My colleague is a bit older and has higher expenses so he likes to have 5K in his checking & 25k in his emergency fund (\~30k). 7k-30k is probably a reasonable spectrum.
2. **Open up an individual broker account in Fidelity or Schwab**. They're both equally good and better than the alternatives. Both have free trades, fractional shares, access to a broad selection of funds without fees, 24/7 customer service, & they don't do shady stuff like Robinhood does (sell order flow to 3rd parties, execute trades at worse prices, make it tricky to sell particular shares for tax purposes).
3. **Put your money in one fund - VT.** VT is the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF. This one fund gives you access to a globally diversified portfolio for a 0.08% expense ratio. Pretty remarkable. If possible, **try not to withdraw $ you've invested within the first year. Capital gains taxes are higher for short term (<1 year) gains.**
4. **If you haven't already, open up a Roth IRA and (if you can) put $6k into VT.** You'll wanna have your IRA with the same broker you use for your individual account so it's convenient. If you already have an IRA, you may wanna roll it over so it's conveniently accessible in Fidelity/Schwab. The law lets us contribute up to $6k/year max into an IRA, which lets your $ grow tax-free, so you'll wanna take advantage of that as much as possible. You wont be able to touch this money until you're 59 and a half years old without a penalty. (Technically, you can actually withdraw the principal, just not the gains.) Of course, at some point if your retirement account becomes massive you may no longer need to add more $ to it but that's obvious.
5. **Whenever you earn money, throw it into VT.** Don't worry about trying to time the market. Everyone thinks they can wait until markets dip and then add their $ but they're rarely lucky enough to do so. Tons of research shows you're best off not worrying about the ups and downs of the day and just contributing as you're able.

1. **decide how much to hold in cash.** calculate how much $ you spend on monthly expenses. if you're healthy & have stable income, set aside $ to cover at least 3-6 months of expenses in a checking account. now think about anything you know you'll wanna spend $ on in the next year (tuition, new car, etc). that's the bare minimum you should be in cash. no harm in adding an extra cushion, just keep in mind that ""investing in cash"" is a decision too. choosing to be in cash locks you in to 2-3% depreciation per year (could become even worse with inflation). the value of cash halves every 16 or 17 years. (!) stocks are volatile and can draw down as much as 30% in a bad year, but over the long term they've returned 10% per year, and most expect average returns of 7-8% per year going forward. once you decide on an amount you always wanna have in cash, write the number down. you'll wanna remember it. since i'm healthy/employed/youngish i'm pretty aggressive. i tend to have 3-4k in my checking account at all times, plus 3-4k in a money market fund sitting in my individual broker account (\~7k). my colleague is a bit older and has higher expenses so he likes to have 5k in his checking & 25k in his emergency fund (\~30k). 7k-30k is probably a reasonable spectrum.
2. **open up an individual broker account in fidelity or schwab**. they're both equally good and better than the alternatives. both have free trades, fractional shares, access to a broad selection of funds without fees, 24/7 customer service, & they don't do shady stuff like robinhood does (sell order flow to 3rd parties, execute trades at worse prices, make it tricky to sell particular shares for tax purposes).
3. **put your money in one fund - vt.** vt is the vanguard total world stock index fund etf. this one fund gives you access to a globally diversified portfolio for a 0.08% expense ratio. pretty remarkable. if possible, **try not to withdraw $ you've invested within the first year. capital gains taxes are higher for short term (<1 year) gains.**
4. **if you haven't already, open up a roth ira and (if you can) put $6k into vt.** you'll wanna have your ira with the same broker you use for your individual account so it's convenient. if you already have an ira, you may wanna roll it over so it's conveniently accessible in fidelity/schwab. the law lets us contribute up to $6k/year max into an ira, which lets your $ grow tax-free, so you'll wanna take advantage of that as much as possible. you wont be able to touch this money until you're 59 and a half years old without a penalty. (technically, you can actually withdraw the principal, just not the gains.) of course, at some point if your retirement account becomes massive you may no longer need to add more $ to it but that's obvious.
5. **whenever you earn money, throw it into vt.** don't worry about trying to time the market. everyone thinks they can wait until markets dip and then add their $ but they're rarely lucky enough to do so. tons of research shows you're best off not worrying about the ups and downs of the day and just contributing as you're able.

to an extent, what's right for you depends on your situation. happy to answer specific questions or hear any feedback in the comments."

nd4uje,soyboymeatsworld,Perspective/advice to someone that just swallowed the index fund black pill?,"I posted some of this yesterday in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and r/valueinvesting. Someone suggested to post it here to get talked down off the ledge. :) What I learned from those conversations yesterday was that I need a better conception of my risk tolerance and a plan I have confidence in. I think that as I've aged, my circumstances changed, and my nest-egg grew, my risk tolerance changed too but I didn't realize it was happening. 

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I've been invested at Vanguard for 2 decades, over which time I've had 13.1% returns. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. Before a January I was almost entirely in the S&P. I have no debts. I'm on track to retire with enough money for my lifestyle.

I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

Most recent update is that after my sell-off freak-out a few days ago, I'm sitting at 42% value stocks, 42% cash, and  16% bonds diversified across US/XUS. 

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people throwing money at speculative investments (currency, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it? Why would I want to buy overpriced assets? I believe in a reversion to the mean. In this market, that means that some day in the future, the assets will cost less than they do now.

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night. I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? Why would I want to spend money on a fund with a p/e of 90 or a value fund with a p/e of 25? Isn't that a growth p/e, even if it's better by comparison?

Lastly, for this forum in particular, I think Vanguard's risk calculator is garbage. I just plugged in my answers and it told me to go 80 stock, 20 bonds. If that's the suggestion in my current mood, then something isn't working right. I spoke with an advisor there that told me 80/20 was the 'conservative' allocation. I think they are drinking their own cool-aid. Who can I trust to help me find my asset allocation?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

Allan S. Roth is a financial advisor who has long been involved with Bogleheads and IIRC participated in Boglehead get-togethers at Vanguard back when Jack Bogle was still alive. He has had his share of Vanguard customer service nightmares and now along with many others of us old timers recommends the ETF products Vanguard sells but NOT the brokerage services.

This article discusses reports from ex-employees of just how poorly trained customer service reps are and how difficult it is to get through to them.  The report of the rude rep refusing to put the caller through to someone with more authority echoes my own experience (though I did eventually get through, three days later.).  My two customer service calls this past week each took an hour AFTER I was connected. They did not resolve my issues.

Indeed, after one issue was resolved, two days later, the company, without notifying me, reversed the fix, and I had to wait another two days for it to be fixed AGAIN.  I am hoping this is the last such reversal (it was the second!) But I can't get my money out of Vanguard fast enough.

15b6mus,pulvarize21,Reached $2 Million mark,"I was checking me and my wife's combined net worth on Mint and Empower Wealth earlier this week and it reached 2.1 Million dollars. The total contains the overall value in stocks/bonds, cash and primary residence. Both of us are currently 33 years old.

I had moved to the US in 2011 at the age of 21 for my master's in Electrical Engineering and was very lucky to have received a monthly stipend and tuition paid through Research and Teaching assistantships at the university which helped with saving while I was a student.

By the time I started working in late 2013, I was able to save about 30k- however I had no idea about the intricacies of finances and investing having moved here just 2 years prior. In addition, my family has always viewed stock market as a gambling house and were deeply against the idea of investing money there (property and government issued bonds were the only asset classes they believed in).

The FIRE, personal finance, bogleheads communities on reddit and the books recommended were very helpful along with some of the youtubers that talk about the theory and principles of long term investing. I remember being completely lost when looking at the 401k options and not knowing what ESPP, RSUs were when I started working. IRA was also a completely unknown concept, and I had never heard of index funds before (or for that matter expense ratios).

The journey towards learning about these concepts, about the temperament for being in the market, long term thinking, importance of cash flows when looking at companies, staying away from FOMO etc. was a gradual process over the first 2 years and I was shocked to see how no one in my circle (including those born and raised in the US, along with those from my country) really knew of these concepts- even those who were several years and decades older than me. To everyone I talked to around me, stocks were mostly about get rich quick and not a slow building of a personal bulwark against any possible future calamities/getting to a point where you can be free of the need to work to survive (making it easier to work on things that are truly interesting). I can see how difficult it must have been for people in the pre-internet time to get good advise if those around you in your circle don't already know of the basics of finances.

Marriage is such an important aspect of FI/saving, I am extremely lucky to also have married someone with similar mindset about money as me- and we both are largely frugal, with an eye towards saving for the future. My wife had also moved to the US around 2015 for work with a similar background in engineering.

It was interesting time in 2021 when we reached the first million with the ebullience in the market, it was the first time it was very hard to stay the path and not get into FOMO trades since I started the journey. Similarly 2022 was the opposite- the doom and gloom made it a hard thing to hold on without just selling out when the overall portfolio was down by 300-500k.

We just had our first child a few weeks back, and the expenses of course will rise from here (the OBGYN/delivery medical bills even with good insurance are quite a shock). I also put in lump sum money in 529 plan to allow it to get the best chance to grow over the next 18 years. I hope to impart the financial knowhow and prudence to her so that she can take it further- I am deeply concerned by the statistics around how 70 percent of wealth is lost by second generation and 90 percent by third generation. Making sure the children understand the importance of having good financial habits and being frugal will be challenging (I remember not having as much money and being restrained on how my parents and I could spend when growing up. I had seen my grandparents generation in especially deep poverty with even regular food being a luxury through their life).

My FIRE goal is about 10 Million (with around 1 Million for medical emergencies, another million to take care of my parents and my spouse's parents in case of any medical or personal emergencies since they are growing older now, 1 million for children's future/education etc., 1 million for any other emergencies and 6 million to ensure a safe withdrawal rate without having to worry about the principal ever running out).

> *""I'm only XX years old! Why would I own bonds, if my 100% stock portfolio has higher expected return?""*

Cliff Asness (director of quantitative research at Goldman) provides a great answer in his **[1996 paper in the Journal of Portfolio Management, ""Why Not 100% Equities""](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Journal-Articles/JPM-Why-Not-100-Equities.pdf?sc_lang=en)**. I encourage you to read the whole thing, it's only 5 pages.

-----

Here's a summary of quotes and main points - but for real, just read the paper:

* ""Perhaps the most important lesson of modern finance is that under certain assumptions, the choices of 1) which risky assets to hold, and 2) how much risk to bear are independent choices.""

    * Step 1: ""Construct a set of efficient portfolios (portfolios with the most expected return for a given amount of risk).""

    * Step 2: ""Choose which of these efficient portfolios to hold.""

* The best risk-adjusted returns are obtained by diversifying not only across the stock market, but also across asset classes. ""Bonds and stocks are both part of an efficient portfolio.""

* A 60/40 stock-bond portfolio with modest leverage has higher returns than a 100% stock portfolio, with equal volatility:

  | Portfolio             | Compound Return | Standard Deviation |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 100% Stocks           | 10.3%           | 20.0%              |
| 100% Bonds            | 5.6%            | 6.8%               |
| 60% Stocks, 40% Bonds | 8.9%            | 12.9%              |
| Levered 60/40         | 11.1%           | 20.0%              |

    * Over a 40-year investment horizon, the 0.8% difference in return between the ""100% Stocks"" and ""Levered 60/40"" portfolios compounds up to around 40%, with the same amount of volatility.

* ""Although the 100% stock portfolio has outperformed the 60/40 portfolio, it is not necessarily the portfolio that does so with the least risk.""

* Even ignoring leverage, ""it is only under very special circumstances that 100% stocks is the optimal portfolio.""

-----

The author also makes some points about leverage:

* A 60/40 portfolio with a modest amount of leverage can has historically had drawdowns (""worst cases"") that are comparable to those of a 100% stock portfolio.

* Some investors feel like using any amount of leverage in investing is ""inviting disaster"", but this is often not a carefully-considered belief. (In reality, most investors are *already* investing with leverage - any investor with a mortgage is leveraged. Going to college with the help of student loans is leveraged investing.)

* Most people can access leverage at near the risk-free rate, if not directly, then by options on indices.

> *""i'm only xx years old! why would i own bonds, if my 100% stock portfolio has higher expected return?""*

cliff asness (director of quantitative research at goldman) provides a great answer in his **[1996 paper in the journal of portfolio management, ""why not 100% equities""](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/aqr/documents/journal-articles/jpm-why-not-100-equities.pdf?sc_lang=en)**. i encourage you to read the whole thing, it's only 5 pages.

-----

here's a summary of quotes and main points - but for real, just read the paper:

* ""perhaps the most important lesson of modern finance is that under certain assumptions, the choices of 1) which risky assets to hold, and 2) how much risk to bear are independent choices.""

    * step 1: ""construct a set of efficient portfolios (portfolios with the most expected return for a given amount of risk).""

    * step 2: ""choose which of these efficient portfolios to hold.""

* the best risk-adjusted returns are obtained by diversifying not only across the stock market, but also across asset classes. ""bonds and stocks are both part of an efficient portfolio.""

* a 60/40 stock-bond portfolio with modest leverage has higher returns than a 100% stock portfolio, with equal volatility:

  | portfolio             | compound return | standard deviation |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 100% stocks           | 10.3%           | 20.0%              |
| 100% bonds            | 5.6%            | 6.8%               |
| 60% stocks, 40% bonds | 8.9%            | 12.9%              |
| levered 60/40         | 11.1%           | 20.0%              |

    * over a 40-year investment horizon, the 0.8% difference in return between the ""100% stocks"" and ""levered 60/40"" portfolios compounds up to around 40%, with the same amount of volatility.

* ""although the 100% stock portfolio has outperformed the 60/40 portfolio, it is not necessarily the portfolio that does so with the least risk.""

* even ignoring leverage, ""it is only under very special circumstances that 100% stocks is the optimal portfolio.""

-----

the author also makes some points about leverage:

* a 60/40 portfolio with a modest amount of leverage can has historically had drawdowns (""worst cases"") that are comparable to those of a 100% stock portfolio.

* some investors feel like using any amount of leverage in investing is ""inviting disaster"", but this is often not a carefully-considered belief. (in reality, most investors are *already* investing with leverage - any investor with a mortgage is leveraged. going to college with the help of student loans is leveraged investing.)

* most people can access leverage at near the risk-free rate, if not directly, then by options on indices. (a modern alternative would be to invest in mutual funds / etfs run by institutional investors following your preferred strategy, such as [ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/capital-efficient/ntsx) (roughly, 1.5x 60/40) or [psldx](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst) (roughly, 2x 50/50).)

    * interestingly: in 2019, [vanguard removed the ability to trade leveraged etfs through their platform](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/leveraged-inverse-etf-etn), but they made a sole special exception for ntsx, which is still tradeable on their platform to this day.

tl;dr: if you're invested in 100% stocks, you're giving up around 0.8% per year of return due to lack of diversification across asset classes."

16nx7su,playdough_guardian,100k... With Strings Attached,"Several months ago, my wife (24F) and I (24M) received a gift of 100k from a relative after an estate was settled. We know this is not necessarily a life-changing amount of money, but it's enough to give us a head start in life, and we don't want to waste that opportunity. After letting it sit in an HYSA for a while, we're wondering what to do with it.

We have 70k net income (more than enough to live in a VLCOL), no debt, fully-funded emergency fund, max our Roth IRAs and contribute employer match to our 401ks.  We don't need this money to live on, and want it to grow for the long-term. I've been a Boglehead since high school. If it were up to me, I would throw it in a taxable account split between VTI and VXUS.

The problem is, the money comes with stipulations. The relative who made the gift believes the stock market is gambling, and this gift was made with the instruction that it could not be invested in the market. I find this annoying, but it's not an uncommon sentiment among older folks in the rural South. We like this relative and get along very well, so won't be doing anything that goes against their wishes. I believe their intention is for us to buy a house/land or invest in a business venture.

I don't want this money to sit in an HYSA for years and get eaten-up by inflation. If index funds are off the table, is buying a home the next best option? I'll be enrolling in law school next year, so we'll be looking to move in 8-9 months. I like the idea of using this money to buy an asset and not having to pay rent while in law school (obviously paying mortgage, insurance, etc.). However, we'll only be in the city we move to for law school for 3 years. I know that's a short timeline to be buying and selling a home.

Is buying a home the right decision? Should I let this money sit in an HYSA? Are there any other options for this money that I'm ignoring/ignorant of? I'd appreciate any Boglehead wisdom.

The interest rate on inflation-adjusted I Bonds is expected to drop to around 6.47% starting Nov. 1

Oct. 28 is investors’ last chance to buy I Bonds that earn a 9.62% interest rate. Yet a surge in demand for the inflation-adjusted bonds has overwhelmed the TreasuryDirect site and the Treasury Department [said it cannot guarantee orders will be completed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-investors-scramble-to-buy-i-bonds-treasurydirect-site-has-outages-11666817951?mod=article_inline) in time.

Many investors managed to beat the clock and the tech issues. As of 4 p.m. ET, nearly 69,000 accounts had been created and more than $710 million in I Bonds purchased on Friday alone, Treasury said. That brings this week’s I Bond sales to about $3.4 billion so far, Treasury said. Five thousand new accounts were created per hour Friday, Treasury said. 

Many investors have reported running into difficulties accessing and logging on to the site.  If a customer receives a confirmation that their purchase has been made or completed by 11:59:59 p.m. ET on Oct. 28, then the payment will be processed, a spokesman said. The Treasury Department said Friday that it would be taking the TreasuryDirect account management system offline Saturday and Sunday for scheduled maintenance. “The maintenance period will ensure TreasuryDirect is able to successfully process the unprecedented volume of I bond purchases made in the past 24 hours,” Treasury said on its site. Customers who complete an I Bond purchase before the scheduled maintenance begins will receive 9.62% for six months, Treasury said. 

 As the deadline to get the 9.62% rate approached this week, the government’s [TreasuryDirect site](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/), the only place investors can directly purchase I Bonds, became one of the most visited federal websites, officials said, and has experienced intermittent outages for several days this week.

you can buy as a gift to someone in your family or others for next year if current year limit of $10k has already been achieved. You can't gift to yourself. 
Consider buying them only if applicable to your situation. Also see many useful comments below>

Hurry or you’ll miss out on one of the best deals in the bond market.

The rate on the Treasury’s popular series I savings bonds will drop in November, probably to about 6.5% from the current rate of 9.6% set in May.

Orders for the savings bonds need to placed by 11:59 p.m. Friday through [the TreasuryDirect website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/i-bonds-interest-rates/) to get the 9.6% rate for the next six months. Bonds purchased by the deadline will have an Oct. 1 issue date.

Bonds purchased Saturday, Sunday, and Monday will be issued in November, and will have the rate announced by Treasury on Nov. 1—next Tuesday, according to the website.

I Bonds purchased this week will have the 9.6% rate for the first six months and the new rate, more than likely about 6.5%, for the following six months, *Barron’s* estimates. Over the next year, the rate should be 8.2%—the math: 9.6% plus 6.5% divided by two, plus compounding. Our estimate reflects compound interest. The estimated 8.2% rate compares with 4.6% on one-year Treasury bills.

The new expected rate reflects the change in the consumer price index from March through September. I bond interest adjusts every six months based on the trailing six-month CPI, which isn’t seasonally adjusted.

An investor is limited to [$10,000 of purchases ](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/how-much-can-i-spend-own/)each calendar year and can buy another $5,000 annually on paper I bonds with the proceeds of federal tax refunds. And an individual can buy another $10,000 in I bonds through certain business partnerships.

The interest is added every six months to the face value of the bond rather than paid in cash to holders. This compounding eliminates reinvestment risk, or the need to reinvest semiannual interest payments.

Someone who buys $10,000 in I Bonds this week should get about $480 in interest in the next six months, which will be added to the value of the bonds, resulting in a holding worth around $10,480.

An individual needs to hold I Bonds for at least a year and redemptions within 5 years result in a three-month interest penalty. The maturity is 30 years.

One favorable feature is that interest on I bonds is exempt from state and local taxes as is the case with other Treasury obligations.

The record rate for the past six months has resulted in a record number of purchases. There were about $5 billion of I Bonds sold in May, a record monthly total.",354,0.9,281,Bogleheads,10/25/22 9:22," <posted to remind community of upcoming changes -

CPI for March 2021 was 264.877. This was 260.280 in September 2020. This is up 1.766% in the past 6 months which is a rate of 3.53% per annum. 

So, if my back of the napkin calculations are correct, the variable inflation rate for **US Treasury Series I Savings Bonds** is going to be 3.53% starting May 2021. 

This makes Series I even more of a no-brainer especially considering the current interest rates.

For those who don't currently own treasuries, you can create an account using the link below.

Things to note before buying US Treasury Series I Bonds.

 1. There is a 1 year lock in period. You cannot touch them for the first 12 months. If this is problem, you can consider laddering i.e. buy a small amount monthly, so you don't have it all locked up. 

 2. There is a 3 month interest penalty if you redeem them in the first 5 years. Considering the current interest rates this is still a better deal.

 3. You can only buy upto $10,000 of Series-I savings bonds per year per person. You can also request an additional up to 5K with your tax returns.

Tax implications:

1. The interest that the Series I bonds earn is  exempt from state and local taxes.

2. The interest taxed as ordinary income at the federal level but it can be deferred until you redeem the bonds.

FOMO, or the ""fear of missing out"", is an inevitable experience when investing. It seems like everyone has a story. Here are a few examples:

* My buddy told me about Bitcoin all the way back in 2011 and I almost invested.
* I sold the equity I got from work and the stock tripled right afterwards.
* I saw the memes about GameStop before the stock took off, I could have been a millionaire.

These experiences can cause significant emotional pain. Feelings of regret, embarrassment, even depression, over what could have been, or almost was.

The truth is that everyone who invests is in the same boat. Whether you have a story like this or not. We all could have theoretically put all our available cash in Bitcoin in 2011. That doesn't mean it would have been a smart move. 

The trick is to view risky investments like a lottery. Do some people win life changing amounts of money playing the lottery? Yes. Do most people? No. Should you invest in lottery tickets? No.

sr0xj5,mynewaccount5,You can't time the market. No not even in your special case.,"Nope. Not even then.

One of the foundational principles of Boglehead investing is to never try and time the market. There is plenty of evidence to back this up. People with billions of dollars seem to try and do it and they seem to do no better than your average Joe sticking their money into a total market fund. 

DCA is a decent strategy in order to overcome nervousness for new investors putting a lot of money into the market. But you should know that lump sum investing is generally the smarter play. Yes even in whatever situation you think we might be at any particular moment in time that makes now different.

I see posts every day asking if you should time the market. They may be long term bogleheads or today might be their first time learning about any of this stuff and this post if for everyone. 

The market will always be doing weird things. Now is not any more special than a year ago or a decade ago. So to the person who is about to make a post asking if they should time the market the answer is no. Should you DCA? Perhaps, if it will help you feel better about investing your large amount of money. That is a perfectly acceptable strategy especially if the alternative is to not invest any money. But the reason is more about emotions and more times than not, you will come out behind than if you had lump summed.

If you disagree with, this that is fine. Feel free to start a discussion about how you debunked this. Boglehead investing might also not be for you and that is also fine. If you are really insistent that you have the secret sauce and can time the market I congratulate you. You can probably sell this secret for such a large amount of money that you won't even need to invest and can retire tomorrow. 

But if you are expecting people to answer your question about timing the market with anything other than no, I think you will be disappointed.

one of the foundational principles of boglehead investing is to never try and time the market. there is plenty of evidence to back this up. people with billions of dollars seem to try and do it and they seem to do no better than your average joe sticking their money into a total market fund. 

dca is a decent strategy in order to overcome nervousness for new investors putting a lot of money into the market. but you should know that lump sum investing is generally the smarter play. yes even in whatever situation you think we might be at any particular moment in time that makes now different.

i see posts every day asking if you should time the market. they may be long term bogleheads or today might be their first time learning about any of this stuff and this post if for everyone.

vjt4t3,mynewaccount5,There is nothing wrong with buying the dip as long as you are not holding back money that you would have otherwise invested,"I've seen a lot of confusion regarding whether or not it is the bogle way to buy the dip and just wanted to add my thoughts to the mix. 

Over the last few months I have been buying the dip. How is this possible you may ask? Doesnt that mean you are keeping money out of the market? That is timing the market! Booooo! Booooo!

Well the answer is simple. I have been keeping my lump sum into the market exactly the same as I always keep it. I havent changed my 401k contribution, my HSA contribution, or my weekly taxable brokerage contribution. Instead what I am doing is adjusting the 50/30/20 formula. Which is 50% on needs 30% on wants and 20% on savings. I have tweaked this to minimize my wants by minimizing my purchases and taking that extra money and dumping it into the market. I am going out to eat to dinner less than I usually would and spending less of my money on frivolous products. That TV I wanted can wait a few more months. I cannot and wont do this forever of course but while the market is down it is always smart to take advantage of it. 

That is how you buy the dip in the Bogle way. There is no need to get snarky with someone for keeping their money on the sidelines or keeping dry powder. This is not a cult where we have to ostracize people for ""violating the rules"", it is simply some guidelines from a smart man about how to easily make enough money for retirement.

wpqsno,monodactyl,Lump-Sum Investing vs. Dollar Cost Averaging: The trade off between higher expected returns vs. peace of mind.,"**TLDR:**

* **Lump-Sum outperforms DCA most of the time.**
* **6 Month DCA period offers negligible cushion in the event of a bad market (-33.5% instead of -35.9% in the worst percentile of outcomes)**
* **Ask yourself whether the reduced magnitude of drawdowns is worth the sacrificed long run returns.**

I saw a few posts recently about DCA vs. Lump-Sum and It prompted me to do an exercise with Schiller S&P Data.

Obviously as Boglehead's we're not advocating for market timing and I'm merely trying to illustrate the trade-off from a different perspective.

https://preview.redd.it/5d5myzbhw1i91.png?width=1698&format=png&auto=webp&s=57abfec8f06e1c03416ba8811036b8727f535dda

At this point, many of us have heard that **time in the market beats timing the market**, The average return for all the S&P data from 1871 to 2022 shows a lump sum investment returning on average 8-9% vs. a 12 month DCA returning 4-5%.

Additionally, lump-sum investing outperforms a 12 Month DCA 67% of the time.

However, despite knowing this, there are arguments to be made for DCA'ing from the **psychological** front. If it's a big windfall, you might not be used to P/L numbers so big and a big drawdown could effect you quite severely such that you even get scared off investing.

You can refer to the table above, but as an example of how to read it:

In the worst 1% of times to invest your windfall, a lump sum would have yielded a 35.9% loss on principle whereas for a 12 month DCA, this blow is softened to a 24.6% loss. Is this worth the average under performance? That's entirely up to you to decide.

For me personally, I don't know if the 6 month DCA period makes much sense because a 33.5% drawdown and 35.9% drawdown feel like they would hurt just about the same.",211,0.94,94,Bogleheads,8/16/22 6:31,"**tldr:**

After 10 years it had -55% returns. Ouch. People who were diversified globally, however, did fine *both decades*.

Point being: if you'd used 2000s results to craft a 2010s portfolio, you'd have done horribly. You certainly wouldn't have tilted toward US growth or tech - you might have left some of that out entirely. And yet here we are, with new people daily asking about tilting toward US large and tech for the 2020s based on the 2010s. I don't know what will do well next. But we do know from prior decades that chasing recent winners can wind up yielding terrible results.

I ask you to *ask yourself*: if you tilt toward US/L/G/Tech and it fails for *ten years*, what will you do? Really think on that. At the end of the day: your investments, your money, your call. I'm just trying to help people avoid mistakes I made, pay it forward to the next generation (in gratitude to those who helped me many years ago). Not sure where to start? Consider a Target Date retirement fund or a baseline of Vanguard Total World + Total Bond. Good luck.

**Update 1:** In the **three months** since I posted this, US large cap growth is up 10% while US small cap value is up two and a half times as much (25%). In fact, small, value and emerging are all ahead of US large, growth and tech. I mention this *not* to recommend chasing these recent winners, but as a reminder that *winners rotate*.

**Update 2:** It's now been **six months** and the spread is even larger. US large caps are up 12% while US small cap value is up 40%. Emerging and developed international each continue to be ahead of US -- *[winners rotate](https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/lqy0cy/update_on_us_largegrowthtech_tilt_warning_from_6/).*

I'm not advising anyone to play the contrarian and buy what isn't doing well, but I *am advising* against tilting toward what has done well recently, because (and I can't type this enough) *winners rotate*. If you want to understand how to invest like a Boglehead, remember that the keys are diversification and staying the course.

P.P.S. Just to head off a common counter-argument from performance-chasers: yes, in theory, if you had bought QQQ and held it while it dropped nearly 80%, then kept investing for 20 years, you'd eventually have come out ahead. Unfortunately, while that sounds simple in hindsight, most investors bail when their stocks drop that far that fast. Notably, too, people are not talking about buying QQQ at a discount right now - rather, it's highest point ever.

P.P.P.S. Some folks are questioning the starting and end points of graphs. I picked the dates I did because it was easy to look at two back-to-back decades, plus it illustrates winners rotating. If you're dead-set on learning the hard way by riding the rising tide of what's hot now, do what you have to. But there are ways to [learn without banking your hard-earned savings on it](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/us_intl_cycle-720x268.gif), and some of those are right there in the sidebar, or among your peers' responses.

P.P.P.P.S. So you're still not convinced - you see those sweet, juicy, tantalizing returns of QQQ or growth or whatever and it's hard to resist. It's natural. The key is to cultivate an attitude of buying low and selling high, diversifying and staying the course. Yes, it's less exciting than gambling, but this is your future, not a poker hand. If you're someone who still needs to learn through losses, so be it - I just hope you learn while the financial stakes are still low for you.

point being: if you'd used 2000s results to craft a 2010s portfolio, you'd have done horribly. you certainly wouldn't have tilted toward us growth or tech - you might have left some of that out entirely. and yet here we are, with new people daily asking about tilting toward us large and tech for the 2020s based on the 2010s. i don't know what will do well next. but we do know from prior decades that chasing recent winners can wind up yielding terrible results.

i ask you to *ask yourself*: if you tilt toward us/l/g/tech and it fails for *ten years*, what will you do? really think on that. at the end of the day: your investments, your money, your call. i'm just trying to help people avoid mistakes i made, pay it forward to the next generation (in gratitude to those who helped me many years ago). not sure where to start? consider a target date retirement fund or a baseline of vanguard total world + total bond. good luck.

**update 1:** in the **three months** since i posted this, us large cap growth is up 10% while us small cap value is up two and a half times as much (25%). in fact, small, value and emerging are all ahead of us large, growth and tech. i mention this *not* to recommend chasing these recent winners, but as a reminder that *winners rotate*.

**update 2:** it's now been **six months** and the spread is even larger. us large caps are up 12% while us small cap value is up 40%. emerging and developed international each continue to be ahead of us -- *[winners rotate](https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/lqy0cy/update_on_us_largegrowthtech_tilt_warning_from_6/).*

upbzkg,misnamed,"HedgeFundie's ""Excellent Adventure"" update: this approach is down around 42% YTD. A non-leveraged 60/40 for comparison is only down 12%. Backtesting to create hindsight-opitimized portfolios is a dangerous game.","Whenever people *stop* talking about a recently hot strategy, I feel the urge to check in on it and see why that might be. The two components of HFEA are **UPRO** (3x leveraged 500 index) **and TMF** (3x leveraged long-term Treasuries). These **are currently down ~45% and ~50%, respectively** YTD. One of the big 'selling points' of this backtest-driven strategy was that it not only had good returns, but  *also* that it held up 'OK' during pretty big downturns, with its *worst* loss being around 50% during the Great Recession (though backtesting too far gets fuzzy, but I digress). A few more weeks at this rate, and it could pretty easily exceed that even in this much shallower pullback.

Anyway, the implicit promise seemed to be: if it didn't do so much worse than, say, a mostly-stock portfolio in *that* particularly dire period, then anything *short* of that it should weather without a huge drawdown. But here we are. For comparison with 60/40 UPRO/TMF I input a 60/40 balanced fund of US stocks and bonds. *Edit: because HedgeFundie draws more on risk comparisons with 100% US stocks, I added that, too.* Here are the results, YTD:

* **Standard balanced 60/40 portfolio: -12%**
* **100% US stocks: -17%**
* **HedgeFundie leveraged 60/40 portfolio: -42%**

So, what happened? The [HFEA portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=272007) backtested well during a period of primarily declining interest rates and overall good returns for the US market. It also benefited from flight-to-safety effects in sudden and severe crashes (bonds helping offset stock losses). But add some inflation, rising rates, and a bit of a stock downturn, which a normal portfolio handled rather well, and the whole thing starts to show its weaknesses in a spectacular fashion.

There's a lesson here, and it's one that shows up over and over again in different forms: don't rely on backtesting alone and ending up fighting 'the last war.' Build a diversified portfolio to weather various circumstances. Or at the very least: be sure you understand *how* and *why* your approach might get hit hard at times. YMMV.

**Edit to add:** some folks are complaining that this is a 'cherry-picked' time period. Here's the thing: cherry-picking can indeed be bad if you're trying to extrapolate out future expectations (e.g. ARKK did amazing for a year, so I infer it should do amazing forever). But zooming in to understand how portfolio assets work together (or don't) under different economic conditions to stress-test a portfolio in a downturn (e.g. peak to trough) can help inform asset allocation.

rwff4o,misnamed,I'm deeply shocked to learn that the main dividend-focused subreddit doesn't allow discussion of taxation,"Dividends are (of course) a significant contributor to long-term stock returns, but as I was looking at the main dividend-oriented subreddit today I was genuinely at a loss for words when I read one of their basic rules:

> The question of taxes often comes up a lot in investing communities, and r/dividends is no exception. However, **we mods prohibit direct questions regarding taxes and other questions of legality because nobody here is a licensed tax professional in every single tax jurisdiction on Earth.**

Obviously no one is licensed in every jurisdiction on Earth (an impossibly high bar), but for the vast majority of posters who are based in the US, dividend taxation represents a huge factor (and in taxable: a massive, long-term cost drag) in terms of overall returns. It is vital that investors be able to discuss current and proposed federal tax legislation, and be allowed to help fellow investors understand state-specific tax consequences as well.

> The question of taxes varies so wildly between regions that even making basic generalizations borders on pointless. The only constant is that you will pay taxes at some point in your life on your investments. Whether it is before you make your gains, after you make your gains, or somewhere in between, you will pay taxes.

Again, generalized dismissals are unhelpful for communities within or beyond the US. Furthermore, the ability to defer or reduce taxes is one of the biggest advantages we have as investors. The variety between regions doesn't make generalizations 'pointless' at all -- these variations are critical factors in determining how to invest. And tax drag absolutely matters -- if it didn't, there would be little point to tax-deferred investing strategies. The ability to strategically control the timing and amount of taxes one pays on investment gains can easily make six-figure differences over a lifetime. This idea that 'taxes will be paid either way' is a dramatic oversimplification.

> The different types of accounts and options available to you varies based on your income, geography, employer, and dozens of other factors. variations on the tax question are so all over the place that I could break Reddit's character limit just covering the most general details.

This is simply and demonstrably untrue. Most posters on reddit have a similar set of options, including: taxable, Traditional and Roth accounts. See links on the sidebar for common and straightfoward answers to taxation questions. There are plenty of helpful wiki pages and other resources covering these basics --- tax-efficient investing allows ordinary investors to vastly improve their long-term gains. I really can't imagine how something so critical to even the most basic (dividend or other) portfolio strategy could be outright prohibited. And when there *is* person-to-person variation, that just makes it *all the more* important that tax questions be allowed.

Please don't brigade the dividend sub (or any other sub for that matter). I'm posting this not as a mod but as a user who is legitimately dumbfounded by the idea that such a critical issue could be banned from discussion altogether. I hope any subscribers to that sub will feel free to ask questions here. For those of you interested in dividend-centric strategies: consider taxation first and foremost, because tax drag can be a huge hindrance to your returns. And in the end, it's total returns that matter (after taxes and fees), whether those come from growth or dividends.

oy91rk,misnamed,So you're thinking about just investing in the 500 index ...,"... here are some reasons you should diversify beyond that.

1) The 500 index has a kind of legacy appeal because for decades it was the only available and/or cheap index fund - that doesn't make it better, it was just easier for fund managers to track a smaller index. Now that global funds are available with thousands of stocks at similarly low costs that legacy reasoning is moot. To put it more directly: if you want to diversify, why would you stop at 50 or 500 stocks when you could own so many more?

2) A lot of people say it's 'diversified enough' but that sets of red flags of its own. The US has unique economic, political, cultural risks - take the Fed, which is holding down rates and arguably inflating stock valuations. Sure, it probably has some impact globally, but it has an outsize impact at home. Add to that the fact that small cap and international stocks (emerging in particular) add real diversification benefits to a US-only portfolio.

3) A lot of people (consciously or not) are anchored on recent returns. Setting aside a huge wave of small cap value catching back up to large cap growth recently, winners rotate.

4) And then there are the appeals to authority. It's *so easy* to fall into the trap of 'well it was good enough for Bogle and Buffett' (two guys whose generation benefited massively from unusually high US outperformance). But two old dudes (bless them both, they're good guys) are not the end-all, be-all for creating a portfolio. Also, they have/had so much money the US could crash and burn and they'd still have come out fine - they're not ordinary investors and I have a hard time believing the advice of billionaires applies to the rest of us.

5) 'But the US is globally diversified already!' This one always stumps my brain, because on the one hand, sure, US companies do tons of international business, but (a) international businesses do tons of business with the US too, so that cuts both ways, and (b) that factoid doesn't account for huge, long-term divergences between actual US and international stocks (which have actually grown *larger* not smaller over recent years!).

It sure seems like a lot of people want to justify chasing recent hot winner, and unfortunately they have a lot of simplified material to draw on - old guys who are a bit out of touch but have the patina of investing geniuses, the fact that the US did do well this past decade (ignoring of course the decade before when it did horribly), and probably some subtle nationalism baked in too, at least for some people convinced of US exceptionalism. But here's the reality: markets reward risk. If the US is safer, it should have *lower* expected returns. So if you want safer, I can't fault you for sticking to the US, but if you want long-term diversified growth, consider branching out.

I've probably missed some reasons along the way - I'm mainly responding to the most common arguments I've read recently. Note: I keep thinking I should unpin the post I made ages ago about recency bias and the US, but the fact that we regularly get *new* posts asking about US/large/growth tilts make me think it's still useful to have that up top.",139,0.87,145,Bogleheads,8/4/21 23:19,"... here are some reasons you should diversify beyond that.

zqqrjk,mastrkief,My company is interviewing for a new 401k provider and have asked me to sit in on the demos and help them make a final decision. What questions should I ask?,"I work at a smallish company (<200 employees) and our current 401k provider is pretty abysmal. Specifically the investment options are lacking with only 1 index fund being available and at a high expense ratio. No target date funds available either.

I reached out to HR to see if we could request more options and they said they'd look into it for me. A month or so later they decided to find a new provider altogether and since I showed an interest they've asked me to sit in on the demos for the 2 finalists they've narrowed it down to and help them make a decision.

I'm thrilled that they're giving me the opportunity to do so but want to make sure I come prepared so what kind of questions should I ask? What features should I look for?

**EDIT:**

Here's what I've got so far:

1. Fees. What do you charge the company, what do you charge the employees? Are there fees for selling, reallocating?

i reached out to hr to see if we could request more options and they said they'd look into it for me. a month or so later they decided to find a new provider altogether and since i showed an interest they've asked me to sit in on the demos for the 2 finalists they've narrowed it down to and help them make a decision.

i'm thrilled that they're giving me the opportunity to do so but want to make sure i come prepared so what kind of questions should i ask? what features should i look for?

**edit:**

here's what i've got so far:

1. fees. what do you charge the company, what do you charge the employees? are there fees for selling, reallocating?
2. how readily visible are fees for each offering? employees should be able to easily compare.

The sheet assumes you bought $10,000 of each fund on 12/31/2021, and then calculates the tax efficiency and total cost based on how many dividends the fund produced based on your marginal tax rate throughout 2022. To use this sheet, just make a copy and update your marginal tax rates and state tax rates on the first tab.

The link is here:  [Tax Efficiency 2022 - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owatGsAWQ3Ep60lo25cpLaj7LoH-FtPSXxNPwGuAMk8/edit#gid=437441803) 

I still do all of these things:

1. Calculate federal tax on non-qualified dividends and 199a dividends, column S.
2. Calculate federal tax on qualified dividends, column T.
3. Calculate federal tax on any long term capital gains, column U.
4. Calculate state tax on all dividends (qual/non-qual/199a/CG), column V.
5. Calculate federal deduction of 20% of the 199a dividends, column W.
6. Calculate state deduction of 20% of the 199a dividends, column X.
7. Sum all taxes, column Y.
8. Calculate Tax Efficiency (All taxes - foreign tax paid / $10,000), column AA.
9. Calculate total cost (Tax efficiency + expense ratio), column AB, copied to D.

This year I used the ICI format data from all three companies, so the inputs work the same. In prior years I was using different inputs for different companies, but this year is all the same. The input fields are still shaded green. I added a trends tab that aggregates my data from the past 3 years, with a sparkline so you can see the total cost trend. Note that the prior years (2020-2021) will not automatically update if you change the tax rates on the first tab. 

 These conclusions are the same as last year:  


* Real Estate ETFs and fixed income funds are pretty tax inefficient and would be better in a tax deferred or tax free account
* Value funds are also relatively inefficient
* US Large Cap and US Small/Mid Cap are very efficient
* Differences between Vanguard and iShares are mostly insignificant except for a few funds, mostly in international

Here are some new conclusions:

* For the prior two years, IAGG had been much more efficient than BNDX, but in 2022 the result was the opposite.
* Last year, international funds across Vanguard and iShares were really inefficient, but 2022 was more like 2020. In 2021, even for high bracket taxpayers holding international funds in a taxable account added somewhere in the range of a 40-50 basis points of cost, but this did not repeat in 2022.
* That being said, international funds had some pretty different numbers between iShares and Vanguard within the same classes but there is not a clear pattern. IXUS looked great this past year.
* Avantis funds are generally higher total cost, which isn't surprising given their higher expense ratio and value tilt.

I hope this is helpful for people trying to optimize their tax bill. But don't let the tax-efficiency tail wag the investment dog.

17ie5ph,ketofree,29 year old chronically ill and not long to live. How to passively invest 200k?,"

Hello

As mentioned in title I have severe and chronic health issues. It’s left me in everyday pain and suffering and inability to leave the house let alone go to work. 

I’d worked at F500 company for many years after graduation.

I don’t have a long span (1-2 decades) either according to the doctors. 

However the only sliver lining I made some great investments in my manic period of life (when I first went from normal to learning about my health) which paid off really well.  That was years ago and I haven’t don’t anything with the money except keep it in my bank.

I’d love some advice on how to invest around 200k and break downs. I want to focus on getting dividend or 
Regular incomes as that would help me like with not having to work. I don’t need more than 1k per month as I live very frugally and mostly home bound. I don’t pay rent either or own a car. 

I was looking into treasury bonds as they have great returns bit I don’t know if I should put everything in to that. 

I also saw a YouTube video of ETFs that could give good (regular) returns in Europe. (He was in Europe) but it seems like you can do the same from any country. 

I was thinking of moving to a cheaper country too with less healthcare costs but again all that would after ive nailed my financial situation. 


This was the what he suggested:
70% Vanguard FTSE ALL WORLD 
20% age delity global quality income 
10% HSBC ftse EPRA NAREIT Developed 

Any thoughts and suggestions please? Im in bad way and all alone and i have really bad social anxiety to trust a money manager etc.

If rather manage this myself.

u318va,just-a-th-to-ask-a-q,Financial Advisor constantly mocking Index Funds,"Hi, so my parents have had a financial advisor forever and last year I mentioned the option of doing index funds.  I got my parents bogle's books.  We've been reading them and they agreed it was a good idea.  The advisor buys and sells individual stocks causing large capital gains taxes every year.  If my parents had indexed, their capital gains taxes would be nowhere near what they are now because there would not be constant buying and selling.  The advisor obliged last year to move all sales of individual stocks when he would normally have a sale to VTI and the bonds to BND.  The issue now is that anytime we speak with him he keeps pointing out the successes he has with the individual stocks and the failures of VTI and BND under similar periods.  Truthfully, over the years in total he has not beaten the index.  But recently he keeps pointing to quarterly successes of certain stocks and recent failures of BND and VTI.  I think we are at a point where our investing style no longer matches the advisor and it's causing a conflict.  My parents still need a hand held even though they'd like to transition to indexing.  We would like to find an advisor that charges hourly rates instead of a percentage of assets to help us plan this out.  Is this something that is available or is there a website for such advisors and is there a way to find one that is completely in line with the boglehead train of thought?

u78683,jpc4zd,"To all new investors: A reflection on ""current events""","I have seen several posts over the past few weeks wondering if now is a good time to invest due to ""current events"" (war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, etc). Here is some reflection on these events:

**Is it a good time to invest?** Yes it is always a good time to invest. As has been proven over and over again, time in the market is the greatest benefit for investors, just ask [Bob](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/).

**But what about \[insert news story here\]?** Here is a list of things (mostly US centered) that have happened since January 1, 2000: Bush v Gore, 9/11, dot com bubble/recession, two different wars that have lasted longer than a decade, anthrax attacks, Great Recession, the ""lost decade"" (2000-2010), Jan 6 insurrection, Covid shutting the world down, introduction of smart phones, social media, Brexit, 5 different Presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden), gay marriage becoming legal across the US, 17 different people have served on the Supreme Court (I'm counting Ketanji Brown Jackson, since she has been confirmed), rise of China, people predicting the world will end ""soon"".

As you can see there has been a lot of things that have happened, both good and bad, and the US and the World have survived, and provided great returns over the past 20ish years. No matter when we look, there were always be stories that make it seem like ""this time is different,"" but yet the world's economy just keeps moving on with an upward trajectory.

**I can't handle the current downward trend in my portfolio, what should I do?** I have 3 things to say to you:

1. Take a break from looking at your portfolio/news. Take a vacation.
2. Remember we are ""long term investors."" Even someone who retires at 65 can still have 20-30 years of investing before they die, and even longer if they want to leave an inheritance.
3. Rethink your asset allocation. If you feel that this current trend is still too much for you to handle, you may be too aggressive with your assets. Look into holding bonds (BND, BNDW, I bonds, GOVT). Now when the markets start to rebound, don't ditch your bond allocation (remember you added bonds for a reason). If you are worried about rising interest rates and bonds, read [this](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=360575).

**How long will this downward trend continue?** I have no idea. It may end next week or two years from now (the S&P had [3 consecutive years of negative returns in 2000, 2001, and 2002](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns)). The best thing to do is to stick to your [investment policy statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement).

**But inflation.** Well, yes it is high. However, inflation was bad back in the mid 70s to 80s also (10+%). I have yet to see an ""updated"" version to BuisnessWeek's August 13, 1979 article ""[The Death of Equities: How Inflation is Killing the Stock Market](https://ritholtz.com/1979/08/the-death-of-equities/)"" (there have been updates, stating that equities have been great since then). The stock market has done pretty well over the past 40+ years.

We also don't have [WIN buttons](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/artifactcollectionsamples/catagories/win/buttona.html) yet (yes that was a thing back in the 70s).

**TLDR:** Stay the course, and don't get distracted from the fact that today's news will have little effect on your portfolio years down the road.",245,0.94,77,Bogleheads,4/19/22 11:44,"i have seen several posts over the past few weeks wondering if now is a good time to invest due to ""current events"" (war in ukraine, rising interest rates, etc). here is some reflection on these events:

13q4z03,imsuperior2u,Was Jack Bogle wrong about international investing?,"Jack Bogle seemed to be against investing outside of the US, which is what I heard him say in many youtube videos including [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvgptl5-Kcc)

To me, his arguments for this seem to be pretty strange: He says that the people dont work many hours in france, and the people in Japan are aging, and sometimes hit by a tsunami, etcetera etcetera. These dont seem like good arguments, because there has to be a reason to suspect the market hasnt correctly priced these things in. It seems just as silly as buying apple stock because a new iphone is coming out, or selling X company because its unprofitable.

To me, picking a specific country to concentrate your investments in is hardly different from stock picking. Its just country picking rather than stock picking. If youre going to say ""Im not investing in this country because they only work part time"", why not say ""Im not investing in this stock because its an unprofitable company"". Whats the difference?

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this? Is there any sense in excluding international investments from your portfolio, or even underweighting them? Or, would you say that just as you dont want to try to pick which stocks will outperform, you also dont want to attempt to pick which countries will outperform, and rather than investing in VOO or VTI, youd be better off in exclusively VT for the equity portion of your portfolio.

rfwx58,hidden-semi-markov,A Modest Proposal to Resolve the US vs Ex-US Debate: Frame it Statistically,"A frequent question that comes up often in this subreddit is, ""The US has trounced Ex-US for the past decade. Why do I need to even bother investing internationally?"" With this post, I'd like to propose an answer to this question -- and to avoid having to repeat myself in comments.

My main issue with this question is that US versus Ex-US isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. In statistician-speak, you're essentially looking at a single probability distribution versus a joint probability distribution.

Why is this a problem? When you combine multiple probability distributions, the resulting joint probability distribution tends to decrease in variance and form around some common mean. (See also: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central\_limit\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem))

Turning to stock returns (I'm simplifying here), each country's stock market returns is in essence a single probability distribution. Generally, stock market returns are highly skewed and have high variance, with the best days for returns being concentrated in just a few instances. (This is why everyone says don't try to time the market.)

Now, what do you think would happen, if we combined all these individual probability distributions representing individual countries' stock market returns together? Obviously, the resulting joint probability distribution in general would have lower skew and variance, and thereby smoothing out extreme positive or negative outcomes.

To put this in perspective, the best developed market to have invested in over the past twenty years *was not the US*. It was *Denmark*. That's right: Denmark. The Danish stock market returned 11.7%, compared to the US' paltry 7.0% over that time period. (Source: [https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/which-country-will-outperform-next-is-irrelevant/](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/which-country-will-outperform-next-is-irrelevant/)). Had you invested $100k in 2001 in Denmark, that money would now be over $900k, compared to less than $400k in the US. (The Danish market beat the US last year and did not too badly relative to the US over the past 5 and 10 years either.)

Did you notice that the Danish stock market had a such great returns for so long? Unless you were keeping close tabs on the Nasdaq Copenhagen index (which face it, very, very few of you were), you wouldn't have noticed. This is because the Danish stock market returns were blended into the overall ""ex-US"" market in your VXUS ETF or VTIAX mutual fund. We should not be surprised by seeing a highly skewed outcome with individual countries, as we are currently observing with the US stock market.

Anyone can easily pick individual countries' stock markets *post hoc.* You can now buy ETFs for individual countries' stock market, if you really wanted to. (Denmark's is $EDEN.) But I personally don't have confidence in my stock or country picking abilities, so I invest globally.

Anyhow, this is my proposal to answer this perennial question. Please feel free to point out anything that is wrong with my line of thinking, but do note that I'm some random person on Reddit and I've made many simplifications here.",202,0.94,107,Bogleheads,12/13/21 21:32,"a frequent question that comes up often in this subreddit is, ""the us has trounced ex-us for the past decade. why do i need to even bother investing internationally?"" with this post, i'd like to propose an answer to this question -- and to avoid having to repeat myself in comments.

132cxbn,globalnomad73,Compounding returns and the long game...,"I just want to give a,few words of encouragement to the younger investors who are earlier in the journey.   Some of these words would have been helpful to me in my younger years.  Just my thoughts and opinions.

Background,  50 yrs old, retirement accts BTW myself and DH is 1.1M as of Apr 2023.  Our earnings were never particularly high, but are solid (middle class) and we didn't receive some big inheritance.   Started investing in the late 90s in s and p index funds.  Weathered two big recessions, first dot com then 08.  In our 50s we are now 65% equities and the remaining in bond index funds.  In our 40s we were 75/25.  When we hit 60 we will do 60/40.  

1 Compounding returns are magic.  10% return when your balance is 50k, is only 5k.  But your balance will grow and compound.  500k will give you 50k a year.  1.1M will give you 110k a year.  It's amazing to see the growth.   We are projecting to have 2.8M by 60, based on current contributions and compounding.   So I'll be sitting here at 60 watching an annual growth if 280k.  It's amazing to have your money make more than your annual income.

2 Always buy no matter what, through thick and thin.  We max out our contributions now, but when we were say 28, we maybe only did say 5-6%  If we got a 2% raise, we upped our contributions by 1%.  Suddenly before you know it you'll be contributing 10 plus percent.  

3 Don't time the market.  Don't do annuities or other quick rich things and individual stock picks.  Don't buy gold. It doesn't innovate.  Recessions are bonus time, as long as you stay the course and don't run for the exits.  We recovered a lot quicker from dot com and 08 bc we kept buying.  08 was bad and I remember I went 6 months without reviewing my balance.  But when the market recovered we were sittingin clover.   Dot com wasn't as bad for us bc we hadn't accrued as much and therefore didn't feel as much pain. But dot com took longer to crawl out of than 08.

Started in 96 and hadn't heard of Bogle back then but I was intimidated by the stock printouts in the newspapers and mutual funds. So I got a couple books from the library and started reading about personal finance my first year investing. I read about index funds right off the bat and just threw all my money in there, specifically s&p and total stock market. I also read about DCA, expense ratios and liked, plus understood the concepts.  Income was solid middle class, comfortable but not wealthy.

In my 20s I was 100% eq. 30s, 85% eq 15% indexed bond funds, 40s, 75/25 etc. Now at 65/35. When 60 comes it will be 60/40 forever.

Looking back I saw it took 20 yrs to go from 0 to 500k. 1996-2016. It took 5 yrs to go from 500k-1M.  2016-2021.  Now I am hearty halfway to 1.5M, standing at 1.2M. I project that I will reach 1.5 in 2024.  So 3 yrs to go an additional 500k.  I did some further projections and see an acceleration as the snowball gets bigger. I should be growing 500k in a 2 year timeline after I hit 1.5M. I based the projections on my current contributions and 10% return.  Obviously these are projections and if we double dip recession everything will be put on the back burner for a while.  But I've weathered two severe recessions (2000 and 2008) and DCAd through it. So I'm not losing too much sleep.  V shaped recoveries are real, at least historically.  

Thought I'd share since I thought it was interesting to see increasing rate of accumulation.  By the way my contributions have mostly been the same, but I have upped it a little every 2-3 yrs but not massively.  Also this retirement funds number does not include inheritance windfalls etc.  By the way this number is for me and long term spouse.

127ae47,dbwy,Getting out of a bad situation,"My wife (32) and I (31) have been getting fleeced by a financial advisor for years - the whole nine yards: managed accounts, whole life, 5.xy% front load American Funds taxable brokerage, you name it. Recently, we've been getting more interested in passive, tax efficient investing strategies and have brought up perceived inefficiencies in our accounts to our FA in our last few meetings. They entertained the conversation for a while, indicating that they would help us restructure to a more tax efficient form ""when the time is right"". 

We've continued to press, which led our FA to go full mask-off in a recent phone call. They beraded  us for being concerned about tax inefficiencies and  ""heaven forbid we pay a little capital gains "". They went on to belittle our investment volume and how ""they don't usually take on clients like us"", and they ""have to make a living"". I mean, I get it, it's a business, but there was something about the aggressive posturing that really opened our eyes to the absurdity of it all. Needless to say, we're out and going full passive strategy from this point forward.

I have a two questions about practical exit strategy:

1. The first (and in retrospect the most absurd) is getting out of our whole life plans. From what I've read (?) we should just be able to cancel these at any time and recover any cash value we've accumulated. Annoying thing is that we've both just paid our annual premium within the last month. Does it make sense to just close everything out now, or should we wait for any pitance of cash accrual over the next year?

2. We have both managed and and brokerage taxable accounts to the tune of about $150k. We're down (like everyone) this year, so we could perceivably sell at (mostly) a loss and move things into a three fund portfolio with low ER. Is there a more efficient way of doing this? Am I missing any potential pitfalls in this approach? I get that there will probably be fees associated with this, particularly for the managed account, but it's a small price to pay to GTFO.

Individual stocks at a brokerage make sense to me - you own that asset regardless of what happens to the broker. That is, if Fidelity went belly up today, then you still own that unit of Brick & Mortar LLC.

However, ETFs add complexity by having a layer of abstraction between you, the investor, and the underlying asset.

rxzook,captmorgan50,The Simple Path to Wealth Book Summary by JL Collins,"# Simple Path to Wealth

- Money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we have created, understanding it is critical. If you choose to master it, money becomes a wonderful servant. If you don&#39;t, it will surely master you
- Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them
- Avoid fiscally irresponsible people and don&#39;t marry one
- Spend less than you earn, invest the difference and avoid debt
- Money can buy many things, but nothing more valuable than your freedom
- Being independently wealthy is every bit as much about limiting needs as it is about how much money you have.
  - It has nothing to do with how much you earn
    - High income people go broke
    - Low-income people gain financial independence
  - Money can buy many things, none of which is more important than your financial independence
- Avoid investment advisors
  - Sound investing isn&#39;t complicated
- Try to save 50% of your income
- Save a portion of every dollar you earn
- If you intend to achieve financial freedom, you are going to have to think differently. It starts with recognizing that debt should not be considered normal
- No one can predict when drops in the market will happen
- Financial independence is about having options (Fuck You Money!!)
- Avoid debt at all costs
- Those who live paycheck to paycheck are slaves
- Many people never learn HOW to think about money. It isn&#39;t about buying stuff
  - Remember the lost &quot;Opportunity Costs&quot; of things we buy
- You can&#39;t time the market, so don&#39;t even try
  - If you could time the market, you would be better than Warren Buffett
- Market crashes are to be expected
  - Toughen up, learn to ignore the noise and ride out the storms
- Why most people lose money in the market
  - They think they can time it – they can&#39;t
    - The majority of investors get worse returns than the funds they pick. Why? Bad timing.
  - They believe they can pick individual stocks – they can&#39;t
  - They believe they can pick the right mutual fund managers – they can&#39;t
    - 82+% of funds fail to outperform the index
  - They watch CNBC and worry about the day-to-day instead of worrying about long term
- Never buy stocks on margin
- Governments love a little inflation. They can add a little money to the system, keep the economy going and not have to raise taxes or cut spending to do it. That is why it is called the &quot;Hidden Tax&quot; because it erodes the buying power of our currency. It also allows debts (like governments) to pay back their creditors with &quot;cheaper dollars&quot;
- Stocks are a good inflation hedge in the long term
- There is no risk-free investment. Even cash under your mattress has inflation risk
- 2 stages in life – not necessarily tied to your age
  - Wealth Accumulation – working, saving and adding money to investments.
  - Wealth Preservation – earned income slows or stops. Your investments are now left to grow and/or provide income for you
- Simple is good, Simple is easier, Simple is more profitable
- Be a long-term investor
- Asset Allocation Rule of Thumb
  - 100 – age in stocks
  - 120 – age in stocks if you want to be more aggressive
- 3 funds needed to build a portfolio
  - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSAX)
  - Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBTLX)
  - Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index (VTIAX)\*
  - Cash or Money Market Fund (Emergency Fund)
    - Stocks are the wealth builder and inflation hedge; bonds are the deflation hedge and you have cash for emergencies

**The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing**

-	Buffet – Newtons 4th law of motion. Investor return decrease as motion increases.
-	Winning Strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever
-	The index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. Only stock market risk remains, which is large
-	A traditional index fund operates with minimal expenses, no advisory fees, with tiny portfolio turnover, and high tax efficiency.
-	Investing in equities long term is a winner&#39;s game
-	The returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market
-	Active Investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.
-	Mutual fund investors are confident they can easily select the right fund managers. They are WRONG
-	When the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with…. Over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company
-	The stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. But this goes up and down in cycles. As investors are willing to pay higher or lower P/E.
-	Investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. About 9.5% for the last 100 years
-	Reversions to the mean – Tendency for P/E ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.
-	Economics controls the long-term stock market return. Emotions control the short term. Accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible
-	Occam&#39;s razor – when there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the most simple
-	Solution – buy and hold a diversified, low cost portfolio that tracks the stock market
-	Investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, BEFORE THE COSTS OF INVESTING ARE DEDUCTED – when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees – the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. The lower these costs the better
-	Before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game, after costs, it is a loser&#39;s game
-	Focus on the lowest cost funds – the more managers take, the less investors make
-	Don&#39;t invest in funds based on past performance. Performance comes and goes. But costs go on forever
-	Costs
  - Expense Ratio
  - Sales Charge
  - Purchase and sale of securities or turnover
  - Assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. IE - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%
-	Low cost funds beat high cost funds
-	Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.
-	Actively managed funds are tax inefficient due to turnover
-	Fund returns are devastated by costs, adverse fund section, bad timing, taxes and inflation

-	when the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with…. over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company
-	the stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. but this goes up and down in cycles. as investors are willing to pay higher or lower p/e.

scdblp,captmorgan50,The Intelligent Asset Allocator by William Bernstein Book Summary,"# The Intelligent Asset Allocator by William Bernstein

- In the long run of investing, you are compensated for taking risks
  - Conversely, if you seek safety, your returns will be low
- Experienced investors understand risk and reward are intertwined
  - One of the easiest ways to spot investment fraud is the promise of excessive returns with low risk
- One sign of a dangerously overbought market is a generalized underappreciation of the risks
- Nonsystematic Risk – Risk that disappears with diversification
- Systematic Risk – Risk that cannot be diversified away
- Stock are to be held for the long term.
- Individual investors are drawn into stocks during powerful bull markets
  - They don&#39;t appreciate the risks with stocks. And after they have suffered the inevitable loss, they sell.
    - No investor ever avoids loses at times, no matter how skilled
- REIT&#39;s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns
  - They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected
- The best way to estimate future stock returns is the DDM (Dividend Discount Method)
  - Return = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth Rate + Multiple Change
    - Dividend yield is the yield on the investment (Example – 2020 S+P 500 yield is 1.5%). The Dividend growth rate is historically 5%. And the Multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall P/E ratio.
    - The Dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). The Multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).
      - Benjamin Graham – &quot;In the short run the stock market is a voting machine (speculative return), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (fundamental return).
- Do not expect high returns without high risk. Do not expect safety without correspondingly low returns
- The longer a risky asset is held, the less chance of a poor result
- Those who are ignorant of investment history are bound to repeat its mistakes
- Dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases returns while decreasing risks. Most important concept in portfolio theory
  - Two assets with positive returns should not have persistent highly negative correlations.
    - Mixing assets with uncorrelated returns reduces risk. You can find these.
      - In the long run though, meaningful negative (inverse) correlations are never seen. That would be too good to be true if they did.
- The optimal Asset Allocation of the last 20 years is unlikely to look anything like the one for the next 20 years.
  - The optimal AA can only be known in retrospect
- Rebalancing increases long term portfolio performance
  - It instills the investor with the discipline to buy low and sell high
- If two assets have similar long term returns and risks are not perfectly correlated, then investing in a fixed rebalanced mix of the two not only reduces risks, but also actually increases return
  - The excess return though is not obtained without rebalancing. It forces you to buy low and sell high to rebalance your asset allocation
- Sticking by your AA policy through thick and thin I much more important than picking a &quot;best&quot; AA
- But in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time
- Real assets are almost always imperfectly correlated (Mostly positive) in real life (An above average return in one is somewhat more likely to be associated with an above-average return in the other)
  - It is difficult to find 2 assets that are uncorrelated and it is practically impossible to find 3
- Correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1
  - Uncorrelated is 0
  - Inverse is -1
  - Perfect is +1
- In general, Bond durations of 6 months to 5 years are ideal for the risk dilution portion of the portfolio.
- If you are unhappy with the degree of risk in the portfolio, you have 2 ways to reduce it
  - Employ less risky individual assets (Not a good idea) – like adding large cap for small cap stocks, domestic for foreign stocks, utility for industrial stocks. It changes the dynamics of the portfolio
  - Stick with your basic asset allocation and replace some of your entire stock AA with short term bonds. (Good idea)
    - Risk Dilution – if you believe that you have arrived at an effective stock allocation, it is generally a better idea to employ risk dilution as this leaves the stock AA undisturbed
      - A conservative risk adverse strategy will almost always involve at least a small amount of exposure to very risky individual assets
- Recency bias – biggest mistake most experienced investors make
  - We tend to extrapolate recent trends indefinitely into the future
  - Try as hard as you can to identify the current financial wisdom so that you can ignore it
    - In 2000, when the book was published, US was doing better than foreign stocks. What were the experts saying at that time?
      - Stay at home for higher returns
      - Buy only companies you know
      - Diversify abroad at your own peril
      - If you do diversify abroad, only do where you can drink the water
- Beware of recency and do not be overly impressed with the asset class returns over periods of less than 2-3 decades.
- Foreign stocks belong in everyone portfolio. The primary benefit is to reduce standard deviation or risks
- Something everyone knows isn&#39;t worth knowing
  - Identify the era&#39;s conventional wisdom and then ignore it
- Next year&#39;s efficient frontier portfolio (high return at low risk or decent returns with no risk) will be nowhere near last years.
  - No one consistently times the market
  - Some managers spend lots of money researching macroeconomic, political, and market analysis to try to guess which assets will perform best in the future. And this is a fool&#39;s errand.
    - Why? The market has already priced this information into the current price
- Periodically rebalance your portfolio back to your policy allocation. This will increase your long-term return and enhance investment discipline
- Effective portfolio diversification can increase return while reducing risks. Achieving this benefit requires rebalancing the portfolio back to its target or &quot;policy&quot; AA. This is difficult to do and almost always involves moving against the market sentiment
- Long term success in individual security selection and market timing is difficult to impossible
- The future cannot be predicted, so therefore it is nearly impossible to specify in advance what the best asset allocation will be. Our job is to find an AA that will do reasonably well under a wide range of circumstances
- Sticking to your target AA through thick and thin is much more important than picking the right AA
- An optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. This is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to &quot;mean revert&quot;.
  - If you can predict the inputs to the optimizer well enough, then you didn&#39;t need an optimizer to begin with.
  - Don&#39;t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can&#39;t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. And if we could, we wouldn&#39;t need one anyway.
    - And optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house
- A well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time
- Diversification not only reduces risks, but also gives a &quot;rebalancing bonus&quot; or extra return from rigorous rebalancing.
  - The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market
  - A distrust of &quot;expert opinion&quot; is one of the investors most useful tools
  - It also limits your exposure to only one market segment
- AA The Three-Step Approach
  - How many different asset classes do I want to own?
  - How &quot;conventional&quot; of a portfolio do I want?
  - How much risk can I and do I want to take?
    - How much complexity can you tolerate and tracking error?
    - The law of diminishing returns applies to asset classes. You get a diversification boost from the first several, after that, you are just amusing yourself
- Examples of various AA based on complexity
- Level 1 AA
  - Large Cap US
  - Large Cap Foreign Stocks
  - Short Term US Bonds
    - Level 1B
      - Small Cap US
- Level 2 AA
  - Large Cap US
  - Foreign Large Cap
  - Small Cap US
  - Small Cap Foreign
  - Emerging Market
  - REITs
  - Short Term US Bonds
    - Level 2B
      - Precious metal equity
      - International Bonds
- Level 3 AA
  - Everything in level 2 but tilt toward value stocks
    - Level 3B
      - Precious Metals Stocks, Natural Resources, Utilities
      - Specific nations equity or bonds
- The more complex your AA, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (Like the S+P 500). You have to ask yourself how much will that bother you?
  - Tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else&#39;s
  - If that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. If it doesn&#39;t, then you can be more complex.
    - Increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error
- It is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique
- Your precise AA will depend on three factors
  - Tolerance to tracking error
  - Number of assets you wish to own
  - Tolerance for risk
- Two types of investors, those who don&#39;t know where the market is headed, and those who don&#39;t know that they don&#39;t know
  - For all practical purposes there is no such thing as stock picking skill
    - Those early high returns attract large number of investors who wind up with average returns (if they are lucky)
- Mutual fund manager performance does not persist and the return on stock picking is zero
  - These managers ARE the market, so there is no way they can ALL perform above the mean
- 4 Layers of Mutual Fund Costs
  - Expense Ratio
  - Commissions
  - Bid-Ask Spreads
  - Market-Impact Costs
- Charles Ellis (an avid tennis player) first saw the data demonstrating a lack of money manger skill. And He thought, I have seen this before in tennis matches.
  - Most amateur tennis matches winning or losing was less a matter of skill and more of matter of playing conservatively and avoiding mistakes
  - This applies to investors, those who simply buy and hold a diversified stock portfolio usually come out on top (Indexing).
    - Success in both tennis and investing is less a matter of winning and more a matter of avoiding losing.
      - The easiest way to lose is to trade excessively.
      - The ultimate loss avoidance strategy is to simply buy and hold the entire market or to index
        - This reduces all the expenses associated with active management
- Dunn&#39;s Law – When an asset class does relatively well, an index fund in that class does even better
- The only money made from newsletters is from the subscriptions, not from taking the advice
- Do not rebalance too frequently. Let momentum work for you.
  - This means to rebalance at most once per year
- Money mangers do not exhibit consistent stock picking skill
- Nobody can time the market
  - Because of the above 2 points, it is futile to select money mangers on the basis of past performance
    - Because of the above 3 points, the most rational way to invest in stocks is to use low cost passively managed index funds
- Stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy
  - But then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)
- Long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive
- Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the 10 lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed
- Dreman has observed that &quot;value&quot; stocks tend to fall less in price than &quot;growth&quot; stocks when earnings disappoint. Conversely, &quot;value&quot; stocks tend to rise more in price than &quot;growth&quot; stocks when earnings exceed expectations.
  - To put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks
- It has puzzled academics EMH theorists why these value type strategies have worked so well for so long even after they were discovered. (The market should have arbitrated this away long ago). The reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. This concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.
- The best explanation for value stocks can be found in Robert Haugen The New Finance: The Case Against Efficient Markets. In 1993 the highest 20% P/E stocks (Growth) had an average P/E of 42. Earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. The lowest 20% P/E stocks (Value) had a P/E of 12. Earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. So, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. If you bought value stocks then, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. That means growth stocks earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks just to break even. The growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.
- Both the behavioral (people don&#39;t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies higher returns than growth.
- Value companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets
- Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.
  - And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won&#39;t receive it today.
    - The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)
      - The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender
        - Safer investments have a lower DR and risker investments a higher DR
      - DR can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset
        - Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value
        - Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value
      - Formula – Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR – Dividend Growth Rate)
        - But you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula
- Dynamic asset allocation refers to the possibility of varying your policy allocation because of changing market conditions.
  - Only people who have mastered fixed asset allocation and the required rebalancing should consider dynamic asset allocation.
  - He used to recommend changing your equity/bond AA based on conditions but that doesn&#39;t work anymore. Now he only recommends changing equity allocations
- When stocks get more expensive, their future returns are likely to be lower and when stocks are very cheap, future returns are likely to be higher.
  - Based on this, it is not a terrible idea to change your AA slightly in the opposite direction based on valuations, but not by much.
    - When you rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target AA, you purchase more of an asset that has declined in price, and thus cheaper.
      - When you actually increase the target portfolio weighting of an asset when its price declines and gets cheaper, you are simply rebalancing in a more vigorous form – you are &quot;overbalancing&quot;
    - Do not change your AA based on changes in economic, political conditions or analyst recommendations, that is a poor idea
      - In the authors opinion, overbalancing is likely to increase return if done correctly. But few investors have the nerve and discipline to rebalance and &quot;overbalancing&quot; requires even more of that nerve and discipline so few should try it.
- The average investor suffers from overconfidence and thinks that they can beat the market, but this is a mathematical impossibility.
  - The average investor must by definition obtain the market return minus expenses.
- Investors suffer from recency bias.
  - When prices fall, investors estimate of future returns goes lower too. This is irrational.
  - Investors tend to overweight more recent data and underweight older data
    - Most investors are &quot;convex&quot; traders in which they buy equities as they are rising and sell as they are falling.
    - The opposite is a &quot;concave&quot; investor who buys as prices fall and sells as they rise
      - In a world dominated by convex traders, it is an advantage to be a concave trader, and vice versa.
- Human beings experience risk in the short term. This is because in nature, our ancestors had to focus on short term risks to survive.
  - Unfortunately, this is of less value in a modern society, specifically in the world of investing.
- Vanguard and DFA are great choices for funds. Vanguard is owned by the shareholders.
- ETFs
  - Advantages – Can be traded throughout the day, do not generate capital gains taxes
  - Disadvantages – Incur commissions and spreads
- Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) vs Lump Sum investing – from a purely financial point of view, it is usually better to put your money to work right away. However, if you are not used to owning risk assets, then it might be best to go slow and DCA your way into the market
  - DCA – Involves investing the same amount regularly in a given fund
  - Do not underestimate the discipline that is sometimes necessary to carry out a successful DCA program.
- Value Averaging (VA) – Is another technique for investing in the market (read the book for more information on how to do it)
- Rebalancing in your tax advantaged accounts every year or two should be ok
- Try not to rebalance in your taxable accounts or do it as little as possible. Try to rebalance though buying because rebalancing triggers taxable events

    - The investor&#39;s objective then is not to find the efficient frontier, rather the goal is to find a portfolio mix that will come reasonably close to the mark under a broad range of circumstances

  - conversely, if you seek safety, your returns will be low
- experienced investors understand risk and reward are intertwined
  - one of the easiest ways to spot investment fraud is the promise of excessive returns with low risk
- one sign of a dangerously overbought market is a generalized underappreciation of the risks
- nonsystematic risk – risk that disappears with diversification
- systematic risk – risk that cannot be diversified away
- stock are to be held for the long term.
- individual investors are drawn into stocks during powerful bull markets
  - they don&#39;t appreciate the risks with stocks. and after they have suffered the inevitable loss, they sell.
    - no investor ever avoids loses at times, no matter how skilled
- reit&#39;s and precious metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns
  - they are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected
- the best way to estimate future stock returns is the ddm (dividend discount method)
  - return = dividend yield + dividend growth rate + multiple change
    - dividend yield is the yield on the investment (example – 2020 s+p 500 yield is 1.5%). the dividend growth rate is historically 5%. and the multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall p/e ratio.
    - the dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). the multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).
      - benjamin graham – &quot;in the short run the stock market is a voting machine (speculative return), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (fundamental return).
- do not expect high returns without high risk. do not expect safety without correspondingly low returns
- the longer a risky asset is held, the less chance of a poor result
- those who are ignorant of investment history are bound to repeat its mistakes
- dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases returns while decreasing risks. most important concept in portfolio theory
  - two assets with positive returns should not have persistent highly negative correlations.
    - mixing assets with uncorrelated returns reduces risk. you can find these.
      - in the long run though, meaningful negative (inverse) correlations are never seen. that would be too good to be true if they did.
- the optimal asset allocation of the last 20 years is unlikely to look anything like the one for the next 20 years.
  - the optimal aa can only be known in retrospect
- rebalancing increases long term portfolio performance
  - it instills the investor with the discipline to buy low and sell high
- if two assets have similar long term returns and risks are not perfectly correlated, then investing in a fixed rebalanced mix of the two not only reduces risks, but also actually increases return
  - the excess return though is not obtained without rebalancing. it forces you to buy low and sell high to rebalance your asset allocation
- sticking by your aa policy through thick and thin i much more important than picking a &quot;best&quot; aa
- but in real life risks, returns, and correlations of various assets fluctuate considerably over time
- real assets are almost always imperfectly correlated (mostly positive) in real life (an above average return in one is somewhat more likely to be associated with an above-average return in the other)
  - it is difficult to find 2 assets that are uncorrelated and it is practically impossible to find 3
- correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1
  - uncorrelated is 0
  - inverse is -1
  - perfect is +1
- in general, bond durations of 6 months to 5 years are ideal for the risk dilution portion of the portfolio.
- if you are unhappy with the degree of risk in the portfolio, you have 2 ways to reduce it
  - employ less risky individual assets (not a good idea) – like adding large cap for small cap stocks, domestic for foreign stocks, utility for industrial stocks. it changes the dynamics of the portfolio
  - stick with your basic asset allocation and replace some of your entire stock aa with short term bonds. (good idea)
    - risk dilution – if you believe that you have arrived at an effective stock allocation, it is generally a better idea to employ risk dilution as this leaves the stock aa undisturbed
      - a conservative risk adverse strategy will almost always involve at least a small amount of exposure to very risky individual assets
- recency bias – biggest mistake most experienced investors make
  - we tend to extrapolate recent trends indefinitely into the future
  - try as hard as you can to identify the current financial wisdom so that you can ignore it
    - in 2000, when the book was published, us was doing better than foreign stocks. what were the experts saying at that time?
      - stay at home for higher returns
      - buy only companies you know
      - diversify abroad at your own peril
      - if you do diversify abroad, only do where you can drink the water
- beware of recency and do not be overly impressed with the asset class returns over periods of less than 2-3 decades.
- foreign stocks belong in everyone portfolio. the primary benefit is to reduce standard deviation or risks
- something everyone knows isn&#39;t worth knowing
  - identify the era&#39;s conventional wisdom and then ignore it
- next year&#39;s efficient frontier portfolio (high return at low risk or decent returns with no risk) will be nowhere near last years.
  - no one consistently times the market
  - some managers spend lots of money researching macroeconomic, political, and market analysis to try to guess which assets will perform best in the future. and this is a fool&#39;s errand.
    - why? the market has already priced this information into the current price
- periodically rebalance your portfolio back to your policy allocation. this will increase your long-term return and enhance investment discipline
- effective portfolio diversification can increase return while reducing risks. achieving this benefit requires rebalancing the portfolio back to its target or &quot;policy&quot; aa. this is difficult to do and almost always involves moving against the market sentiment
- long term success in individual security selection and market timing is difficult to impossible
- the future cannot be predicted, so therefore it is nearly impossible to specify in advance what the best asset allocation will be. our job is to find an aa that will do reasonably well under a wide range of circumstances
- sticking to your target aa through thick and thin is much more important than picking the right aa
- an optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. this is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to &quot;mean revert&quot;.
  - if you can predict the inputs to the optimizer well enough, then you didn&#39;t need an optimizer to begin with.
  - don&#39;t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. we can&#39;t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. and if we could, we wouldn&#39;t need one anyway.
    - and optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house
- a well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. it does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. you will still suffer loss from time to time
- diversification not only reduces risks, but also gives a &quot;rebalancing bonus&quot; or extra return from rigorous rebalancing.
  - the benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market
  - a distrust of &quot;expert opinion&quot; is one of the investors most useful tools
  - it also limits your exposure to only one market segment
- aa the three-step approach
  - how many different asset classes do i want to own?
  - how &quot;conventional&quot; of a portfolio do i want?
  - how much risk can i and do i want to take?
    - how much complexity can you tolerate and tracking error?
    - the law of diminishing returns applies to asset classes. you get a diversification boost from the first several, after that, you are just amusing yourself
- examples of various aa based on complexity
- level 1 aa
  - large cap us
  - large cap foreign stocks
  - short term us bonds
    - level 1b
      - small cap us
- level 2 aa
  - large cap us
  - foreign large cap
  - small cap us
  - small cap foreign
  - emerging market
  - reits
  - short term us bonds
    - level 2b
      - precious metal equity
      - international bonds
- level 3 aa
  - everything in level 2 but tilt toward value stocks
    - level 3b
      - precious metals stocks, natural resources, utilities
      - specific nations equity or bonds
- the more complex your aa, the more tracking error you will get vs the index (like the s+p 500). you have to ask yourself how much will that bother you?
  - tracking error means that your portfolio will behave very differently than everyone else&#39;s
  - if that bothers you, then you need a simpler portfolio. if it doesn&#39;t, then you can be more complex.
    - increasing the number of asset classes will improve diversification but will also increase your work and tracking error
- it is impossible to forecast future optional portfolios by any technique
- your precise aa will depend on three factors
  - tolerance to tracking error
  - number of assets you wish to own
  - tolerance for risk
- two types of investors, those who don&#39;t know where the market is headed, and those who don&#39;t know that they don&#39;t know
  - for all practical purposes there is no such thing as stock picking skill
    - those early high returns attract large number of investors who wind up with average returns (if they are lucky)
- mutual fund manager performance does not persist and the return on stock picking is zero
  - these managers are the market, so there is no way they can all perform above the mean
- 4 layers of mutual fund costs
  - expense ratio
  - commissions
  - bid-ask spreads
  - market-impact costs
- charles ellis (an avid tennis player) first saw the data demonstrating a lack of money manger skill. and he thought, i have seen this before in tennis matches.
  - most amateur tennis matches winning or losing was less a matter of skill and more of matter of playing conservatively and avoiding mistakes
  - this applies to investors, those who simply buy and hold a diversified stock portfolio usually come out on top (indexing).
    - success in both tennis and investing is less a matter of winning and more a matter of avoiding losing.
      - the easiest way to lose is to trade excessively.
      - the ultimate loss avoidance strategy is to simply buy and hold the entire market or to index
        - this reduces all the expenses associated with active management
- dunn&#39;s law – when an asset class does relatively well, an index fund in that class does even better
- the only money made from newsletters is from the subscriptions, not from taking the advice
- do not rebalance too frequently. let momentum work for you.
  - this means to rebalance at most once per year
- money mangers do not exhibit consistent stock picking skill
- nobody can time the market
  - because of the above 2 points, it is futile to select money mangers on the basis of past performance
    - because of the above 3 points, the most rational way to invest in stocks is to use low cost passively managed index funds
- stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy
  - but then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (growth stocks)
- long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive
- paul miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the dow p/e strategy. he examined buying the 10 lowest p/e stocks in the dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest p/e stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest p/e stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed
- dreman has observed that &quot;value&quot; stocks tend to fall less in price than &quot;growth&quot; stocks when earnings disappoint. conversely, &quot;value&quot; stocks tend to rise more in price than &quot;growth&quot; stocks when earnings exceed expectations.
  - to put it another way, good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks
- it has puzzled academics emh theorists why these value type strategies have worked so well for so long even after they were discovered. (the market should have arbitrated this away long ago). the reason the strategies still work is that cheap companies are dogs, and most people cannot bring themselves to buy them. this concept is very difficult for investors and money managers alike.
- the best explanation for value stocks can be found in robert haugen the new finance: the case against efficient markets. in 1993 the highest 20% p/e stocks (growth) had an average p/e of 42. earnings yield was 2.36% or 1/42. the lowest 20% p/e stocks (value) had a p/e of 12. earnings yield was 8.38% or 1/12. so, if you bought growth stocks in 1993, you received $2.36 for every $100 invested. if you bought value stocks then, you received $8.38 in earnings for every $100 invested. that means growth stocks earnings have to grow 3x larger than value stocks just to break even. the growth stocks did have higher earnings than value, but not enough to catch up.
- both the behavioral (people don&#39;t like buying bad companies) and increased risk (companies are not in great financial shape) explain value companies higher returns than growth.
- value companies tend to do better than growth during bear markets
- dividend discount method (ddm) formulated by john burr williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.
  - and since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won&#39;t receive it today.
    - the reduction is called the discount rate (dr)
      - the dr is determined by the cost of money (risk free rate) plus the risk to the lender
        - safer investments have a lower dr and risker investments a higher dr
      - dr can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset
        - lower risks = lower dr = lower expected return/higher present value
        - higher risks = higher dr = higher expected return/lower present value
      - formula – reasonable price = (annual dividend amount)/(dr – dividend growth rate)
        - but you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. so be careful with this formula
- dynamic asset allocation refers to the possibility of varying your policy allocation because of changing market conditions.
  - only people who have mastered fixed asset allocation and the required rebalancing should consider dynamic asset allocation.
  - he used to recommend changing your equity/bond aa based on conditions but that doesn&#39;t work anymore. now he only recommends changing equity allocations
- when stocks get more expensive, their future returns are likely to be lower and when stocks are very cheap, future returns are likely to be higher.
  - based on this, it is not a terrible idea to change your aa slightly in the opposite direction based on valuations, but not by much.
    - when you rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target aa, you purchase more of an asset that has declined in price, and thus cheaper.
      - when you actually increase the target portfolio weighting of an asset when its price declines and gets cheaper, you are simply rebalancing in a more vigorous form – you are &quot;overbalancing&quot;
    - do not change your aa based on changes in economic, political conditions or analyst recommendations, that is a poor idea
      - in the authors opinion, overbalancing is likely to increase return if done correctly. but few investors have the nerve and discipline to rebalance and &quot;overbalancing&quot; requires even more of that nerve and discipline so few should try it.
- the average investor suffers from overconfidence and thinks that they can beat the market, but this is a mathematical impossibility.
  - the average investor must by definition obtain the market return minus expenses.
- investors suffer from recency bias.
  - when prices fall, investors estimate of future returns goes lower too. this is irrational.
  - investors tend to overweight more recent data and underweight older data
    - most investors are &quot;convex&quot; traders in which they buy equities as they are rising and sell as they are falling.
    - the opposite is a &quot;concave&quot; investor who buys as prices fall and sells as they rise
      - in a world dominated by convex traders, it is an advantage to be a concave trader, and vice versa.
- human beings experience risk in the short term. this is because in nature, our ancestors had to focus on short term risks to survive.
  - unfortunately, this is of less value in a modern society, specifically in the world of investing.
- vanguard and dfa are great choices for funds. vanguard is owned by the shareholders.
- etfs
  - advantages – can be traded throughout the day, do not generate capital gains taxes
  - disadvantages – incur commissions and spreads
- dollar cost averaging (dca) vs lump sum investing – from a purely financial point of view, it is usually better to put your money to work right away. however, if you are not used to owning risk assets, then it might be best to go slow and dca your way into the market
  - dca – involves investing the same amount regularly in a given fund
  - do not underestimate the discipline that is sometimes necessary to carry out a successful dca program.
- value averaging (va) – is another technique for investing in the market (read the book for more information on how to do it)
- rebalancing in your tax advantaged accounts every year or two should be ok
- try not to rebalance in your taxable accounts or do it as little as possible. try to rebalance though buying because rebalancing triggers taxable events

summary

  - risk and reward and inextricably entwined
    - do not expect high returns from safe assets
  - those who do not learn from history and condemned to repeat it
    - become familiar with the long-term history of the behavior of different classes of stocks and bonds
  - portfolios behave differently than their constituent parts
    - a safe portfolio does not necessarily exclude very risky assets. even the investor who seeks the safest possible portfolio will own some risky assets
  - for a given degree of risk, there is a portfolio that will deliver the most return
    - but this can only be known in retrospect
    - the investor&#39;s objective then is not to find the efficient frontier, rather the goal is to find a portfolio mix that will come reasonably close to the mark under a broad range of circumstances
  - focus on the behavior of your whole portfolio, not its parts. some will be doing very well or very bad at times
  - recognize the benefits of rebalancing
  - the markets are smarter than you are
    - very few money mangers beat the market over the long term
    - do not run with the crowd
  - keep an eye on market valuations
    - changes in your policy aa should be made only in response to valuations changes, and in a direction opposite the market
  - good companies are usually bad stocks; bad companies are usually good stocks
    - favor a &quot;value&quot; approach to investing
  - in the long run, it is very hard to beat a low-cost index fund"

# **Fooled by Randomness**

- Survivorship Bias means you don&#39;t hear from the losers on a topic, you only hear from the winners.
  - Watch out judging a person by their results because history will only show you the winners. You won&#39;t hear the stories of the losers
- Over short terms, you see variance, not returns. Don&#39;t monitor your portfolio on a daily basis
- AFTER an event has occurred, it is easy to make a story as to why it happened and why people should have seen it. But it is difficult to see in advance BEFORE it happens
  - Events are more random than we think
- Negative pangs cause a 2.5x more emotional response than a positive one
- It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made or lost when it happens that should be the consideration
  - Maximize your profit expectancy, not probability
- I try to benefit from &quot;rare events&quot;, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently
- I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price
- Investors for pure emotional reasons, will be drawn into strategies that experience rare but large variations.
- Pascal&#39;s Wager – The optimal strategy for humans is to believe in God because if God does exist the believer will be rewarded and if he doesn&#39;t exist, the believer has nothing to lose.
  - IE - Inequality of outcomes, don&#39;t try to pick up nickels in front of a train
- There is no point in searching for patterns that are available to everyone; once detected, they would be self-canceling
- &quot;One cannot judge a performance in any given field by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. if history played out in a different way). Such substitutes courses of events are called alternative histories. Cleary the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome.
- Past events will always look less random than they were (hindsight bias)
- Probability almost never presents itself as a mathematical problem or brain teaser
- No one accepts randomness in their success, only in their failure
- Take into account the costs of mistakes
- Bad information is worse than no information at all
- 5 traits of a Market Fool
  - Overestimating accuracy of data or overconfidence
  - Getting married to positions
  - Changing story
  - No plans for taking losses or exit strategy
  - Denial of luck and randomness

# **The Black Swan**

- 3 attributes for a black swan
  - A black swan is an outlier, as in outside the realm of regular expectations
  - Carries extreme impact
  - Human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence _ **after** _ the fact
    - Rare, Extreme Impact and Retrospective predictability
- There are great problems with trying to forecast the future, given limited knowledge of the past
- Black swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence rather than naively try to predict them
- The human mind suffers from 3 ailments as it comes into contact with history
  - The illusion of understanding or how everyone thinks they know what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
  - Retrospective distortion or how we assess matter only after the fact (history seems clearer and more organized in books than in empirical reality)
  - Overvaluation of factual information
- Taleb realized that he was totally incapable of predicting market prices, but that others were just as incapable as him but did not know it or did not know that they were taking massive risks. Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller
- 2 types of randomness analogy
  - Mediocristan – land of average
  - Extremistan – land of black swans
    - Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE – Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ
      - Black swans don&#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.
    - Extemistan – inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE – wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data
      - Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.
- Black Swan Example – Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &quot;looking out for my best interests&quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.
  - The turkey had &quot;learned backwards&quot; from observation
  - oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?
  - Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&#39;t. You don&#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.
    - Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &quot;Black Monday&quot;
- Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly
- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- Naïve Empiricism – We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.
- Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Naïve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _Necessarily_ evidence.
  - Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.
- The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.
- Confirmation Bias – our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.
  - To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong
- Narrative Fallacy – this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events
  - We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&#39;t
    - The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.
- In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.
  - Most people have a preference for number 1
  - Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina
- We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.
- Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off
- We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.
- Taleb&#39;s Perfect World – &quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.
- Louis Pasteur – &quot;Luck favors the prepared&quot;
- The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right
- So, what to do if you can&#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??
  - Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example – don&#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.
  - Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions
  - Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities
  - People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.
  - Barbell Strategy
    - Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative
    - Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments – (Example – T-Bills)
    - Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example – VC)
    - You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans
    - Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones
    - I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan

# **Anti-Fragile**

- Fragile-Robust-Antifragile. Fragile wants tranquility, Antifragile grows from disorder and robust doesn&#39;t care too much
- Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. This is Antifragile. The opposite is fragile
- Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets stronger
- I would rather be dumb and antifragile than smart and fragile
  - It is much easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.
- Asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events is antifragile; the reverse is fragile
- Fragile needs to be very predictive in its approach, and conversely, predictive systems cause fragility
- For the economy to be antifragile as a whole, individual companies must be fragile. We don&#39;t have this currently
  - Many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established
- We are fragilizing social and economic systems by denying them stressors and randomness
- We make social, political (and other) systems vulnerable to Black Swans when we over stabilize them
- The problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks. They become prone to black swan events
- Attempts at eliminating the business cycle led to more fragile economic systems (IE – The Greenspan Put)
  - Part of this is due to the fact it is easier to sell &quot;Look what I did for you&quot; than &quot;Look what I avoided for you.&quot;
- Our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is about zero
- What makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don&#39;t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile, and they do not need to forecast
  - A person with extra cash in the bank and stockpiles of tradeable goods and gold bars doesn&#39;t need to forecast correctly.
  - People in debt are fragile and need a lot more forecasting ability
- There are 2 types of domains
  - Those we can somewhat predict. IE – The physical like planet motions
  - Those that we cannot. IE - The Black Swan – Social, Economic, and Cultural life
- The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside. That means lowering exposure to negative black swans
- What matters is the route taken, the order of events, not just the destination – what scientists call path-dependent property
  - Example – A kidney stone operation and anesthesia after is very different than the opposite
- People miss the strong logical precedence of survival over success
- In other words, if something is fragile, its risk of breaking make anything you do to improve it or make it &quot;efficient&quot; inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking
- Barbell Strategy or Bimodal Strategy
  - Combination of 2 extreme areas with nothing in the middle
    - Playing it safe in some areas – robust to black swans
    - Taking a lot of small risks in other – open to positive black swans
      - The whole then becomes antifragile
- The causes extreme risk aversion on one side and extreme risk loving on the other
  - But the barbell also results, because of its construction, in the reduction of downside risk – the elimination of the risk of ruin
- Antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia, protect your downside from extreme harm, and let the upside take care of itself
- Yiddish proverb &quot;Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself.&quot;
  - Many people tend to provide for the best and hope the worst takes care of itself
- Example of above
  - People find insuring their house a necessity, not something to be judged against a financial strategy, but when it comes to their portfolios, because of the way things are framed in the press, they don&#39;t look at them the same way.
  - They think that the barbell strategy needs to be examined for its potential return as an investment. That is NOT the point. The barbell is simply an idea of insurance of survival
- When you are fragile, you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. Conversely, when you think you know more than you do, you are fragile to error.
  - Overconfidence leads to reliance on forecasts, which causes borrowing, then to the fragility of leverage. Example – Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)
- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- Much of what other people know isn&#39;t worth knowing
- Non-linear means that the response is not straightforward and not in a straight line, so if you double say, the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect.
- For the fragile, shocks bring higher and higher harm as their intensity increases (up to a point)
  - Example – Falling from a height of 30ft one time brings more than 30 times the harm of falling 30 times from a height of 1ft
- What is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects
- The fragile is hurt a lot more by extreme events than by a succession of intermediate ones
- For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits as their intensity increases (up to a point)
  - Example – powerlifters get more benefits lifting 300 lbs one time than 1 lb 300 times
    - Every additional pound brings more benefits, until one gets close to the limit, what would be known as &quot;failure&quot;
- Convexity effect analogy (Positive and Negative) Think of a smile (+) and frown (-)
  - Positive – Convex – Think Happy face - Gain more than pain. Likes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more upside than downside, it will be convex (slopes up)
  - Negative - Concave – Think Sad face – Pain more than gain. Dislikes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more downside than upside, it will be concave (slopes down). The more harm from the unexpected. Large deviations have a disproportionately larger and larger effect (acceleration)
- The inverse philosophers stone or how to detect fragility
  - Figure out if our miscalculations or mis forecasts are on balance more harmful than they are beneficial, and how accelerating the damage will be.
    - You don&#39;t have to be exact with this measurement. You can get a scale that isn&#39;t zeroed and know if you are gaining or losing weight. I can have a non-exact ruler and know if my child is growing or not.
  - Example – Government deficits are particularly concave to changes in economic conditions. Every additional deviation in, say, the unemployment rate, particularly when the government has debt, makes deficits incrementally worse.
  - Financial leverage for a company has the same effect: you need to borrow more and more to get the same result
- Average (First order effects) do not matter
  - &quot;Do not cross a river if it is on average 4ft deep&quot;
  - Analogy – You grandmother will spend the next 2 hours at 70 degrees (Perfect Grandmother Temp).
    - But there is also a second point of the data – she will spend the first hour at 0 and the 2nd hour at 140 for an average of 70
    - Temp changes become more and more harmful as they deviate from 70. And the 2nd piece of information, the variability, turned out to be more important than the first.
  - Point of above – The notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations
    - Grandmother is non-linear to temperature (response is not a straight line), it curves inward (concave), the more nonlinear the response, the less relevant the average
- Many people are drawn to financial markets because we hear or see the success, but the failures are buried and we don&#39;t hear about them",185,0.94,52,Bogleheads,12/7/21 1:13,"nassim taleb

      - black swans do occur here. you will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. difficult or even impossible to predict.
- black swan example – consider a turkey that is fed every day. every single feeding will firm up the bird&#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &quot;looking out for my best interests&quot;. but the wednesday before thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. it will occur a revision of belief. ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.
  - the turkey had &quot;learned backwards&quot; from observation
  - ohow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?
  - something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&#39;t. you don&#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.
    - before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the dow could drop in a day was 13%. it dropped 22% on &quot;black monday&quot;
- positive black swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly
- absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- naïve empiricism – we tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. you take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.
- negative empiricism - the way to counter your naïve empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _necessarily_ evidence.
  - seeing white swans does not confirm the nonexistence of black swans.
- the error of confirmation - we are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.
- confirmation bias – our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.
  - to counter this george soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong
- narrative fallacy – this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. it severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events
  - we tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. explanations bind these facts together. making them easy to remember. they help us make more sense of the facts. because our brains can&#39;t store all that information. stories stick, statistics don&#39;t
    - the more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.
- in some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. in other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. in other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&#39;t happen. these require completely different mind sets.
  - most people have a preference for number 1
  - some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina
- we favor the narrated. we are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. we respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.
- our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. when you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. so those who delay developing their theories are better off
- we humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. we attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. we feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.
- taleb&#39;s perfect world – &quot;think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. he lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &quot;i don&#39;t know.&quot; he does not mind looking like a fool. he hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. he introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. this does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.
- louis pasteur – &quot;luck favors the prepared&quot;
- the black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right
- so, what to do if you can&#39;t predict in a world with black swans??
  - avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. be fooled in small matters, not large. example – don&#39;t accept the government forecast for ss payments 50 years from now.
  - do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions
  - be prepared! be prepared for all relevant eventualities
  - people are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.
  - barbell strategy
    - be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative
    - put 80-90% in extremely safe investments – (example – t-bills)
    - put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (example – vc)
    - you have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. this minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans
    - put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones
    - i am very aggressive when i can gain exposure to positive black swans and very conservative when i am under threat from a negative black swan

# **anti-fragile**

- fragile-robust-antifragile. fragile wants tranquility, antifragile grows from disorder and robust doesn&#39;t care too much
- some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. this is antifragile. the opposite is fragile
- antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. the resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets stronger
- i would rather be dumb and antifragile than smart and fragile
  - it is much easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.
- asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events is antifragile; the reverse is fragile
- fragile needs to be very predictive in its approach, and conversely, predictive systems cause fragility
- for the economy to be antifragile as a whole, individual companies must be fragile. we don&#39;t have this currently
  - many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established
- we are fragilizing social and economic systems by denying them stressors and randomness
- we make social, political (and other) systems vulnerable to black swans when we over stabilize them
- the problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks. they become prone to black swan events
- attempts at eliminating the business cycle led to more fragile economic systems (ie – the greenspan put)
  - part of this is due to the fact it is easier to sell &quot;look what i did for you&quot; than &quot;look what i avoided for you.&quot;
- our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is about zero
- what makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don&#39;t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile, and they do not need to forecast
  - a person with extra cash in the bank and stockpiles of tradeable goods and gold bars doesn&#39;t need to forecast correctly.
  - people in debt are fragile and need a lot more forecasting ability
- there are 2 types of domains
  - those we can somewhat predict. ie – the physical like planet motions
  - those that we cannot. ie - the black swan – social, economic, and cultural life
- the first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside. that means lowering exposure to negative black swans
- what matters is the route taken, the order of events, not just the destination – what scientists call path-dependent property
  - example – a kidney stone operation and anesthesia after is very different than the opposite
- people miss the strong logical precedence of survival over success
- in other words, if something is fragile, its risk of breaking make anything you do to improve it or make it &quot;efficient&quot; inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking
- barbell strategy or bimodal strategy
  - combination of 2 extreme areas with nothing in the middle
    - playing it safe in some areas – robust to black swans
    - taking a lot of small risks in other – open to positive black swans
      - the whole then becomes antifragile
- the causes extreme risk aversion on one side and extreme risk loving on the other
  - but the barbell also results, because of its construction, in the reduction of downside risk – the elimination of the risk of ruin
- antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia, protect your downside from extreme harm, and let the upside take care of itself
- yiddish proverb &quot;provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself.&quot;
  - many people tend to provide for the best and hope the worst takes care of itself
- example of above
  - people find insuring their house a necessity, not something to be judged against a financial strategy, but when it comes to their portfolios, because of the way things are framed in the press, they don&#39;t look at them the same way.
  - they think that the barbell strategy needs to be examined for its potential return as an investment. that is not the point. the barbell is simply an idea of insurance of survival
- when you are fragile, you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. conversely, when you think you know more than you do, you are fragile to error.
  - overconfidence leads to reliance on forecasts, which causes borrowing, then to the fragility of leverage. example – long term capital management (ltcm)
- absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- much of what other people know isn&#39;t worth knowing
- non-linear means that the response is not straightforward and not in a straight line, so if you double say, the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect.
- for the fragile, shocks bring higher and higher harm as their intensity increases (up to a point)
  - example – falling from a height of 30ft one time brings more than 30 times the harm of falling 30 times from a height of 1ft
- what is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects
- the fragile is hurt a lot more by extreme events than by a succession of intermediate ones
- for the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits as their intensity increases (up to a point)
  - example – powerlifters get more benefits lifting 300 lbs one time than 1 lb 300 times
    - every additional pound brings more benefits, until one gets close to the limit, what would be known as &quot;failure&quot;
- convexity effect analogy (positive and negative) think of a smile (+) and frown (-)
  - positive – convex – think happy face - gain more than pain. likes volatility. if for a given variation, you have more upside than downside, it will be convex (slopes up)
  - negative - concave – think sad face – pain more than gain. dislikes volatility. if for a given variation, you have more downside than upside, it will be concave (slopes down). the more harm from the unexpected. large deviations have a disproportionately larger and larger effect (acceleration)
- the inverse philosophers stone or how to detect fragility
  - figure out if our miscalculations or mis forecasts are on balance more harmful than they are beneficial, and how accelerating the damage will be.
    - you don&#39;t have to be exact with this measurement. you can get a scale that isn&#39;t zeroed and know if you are gaining or losing weight. i can have a non-exact ruler and know if my child is growing or not.
  - example – government deficits are particularly concave to changes in economic conditions. every additional deviation in, say, the unemployment rate, particularly when the government has debt, makes deficits incrementally worse.
  - financial leverage for a company has the same effect: you need to borrow more and more to get the same result
- average (first order effects) do not matter
  - &quot;do not cross a river if it is on average 4ft deep&quot;
  - analogy – you grandmother will spend the next 2 hours at 70 degrees (perfect grandmother temp).
    - but there is also a second point of the data – she will spend the first hour at 0 and the 2nd hour at 140 for an average of 70
    - temp changes become more and more harmful as they deviate from 70. and the 2nd piece of information, the variability, turned out to be more important than the first.
  - point of above – the notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations
    - grandmother is non-linear to temperature (response is not a straight line), it curves inward (concave), the more nonlinear the response, the less relevant the average
- many people are drawn to financial markets because we hear or see the success, but the failures are buried and we don&#39;t hear about them"

-	Buffet – Newtons 4th law of motion. Investor return decrease as motion increases.
-	Winning Strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever
-	The index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. Only stock market risk remains, which is large
-	The returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market
-	Active Investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.
-	The stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. But this goes up and down in cycles. As investors are willing to pay higher or lower P/E.
-	Investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. About 9.5% for the last 100 years
-	Reversions to the mean – Tendency for P/E ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.
-	Economics controls the long-term stock market return. Emotions control the short term. Accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible
-	Investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, BEFORE THE COSTS OF INVESTING ARE DEDUCTED – when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees – the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. The lower these costs the better
  - Assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. IE - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%
-	Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.
-	As the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.
-	Picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty
-	Over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?
  - Bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years

All About Asset Allocation

- As a nation, we are not saving enough in retirement accounts to make up for diminishing Social Security benefits and other traditional sources of income
  - It is unreliable to assume that managers who have beaten the market in the past will continue to do so over the long term
- On any given year, the index fund will be beat by many active managed funds. But in the long run, the index fund will be at the top
- Earnings Growth (Corporate Earnings or GDP) +Dividend (Yield)+Speculation (P/E ratio) = market return
- In the short run, speculation creates the volatility in stock prices, but in the long term, economic growth is the real driver of returns. You can&#39;t guess what P/E ratio the market will assign in the future so don&#39;t try

The Investors Manifesto

- Gordon&#39;s Equation
    - Expected return = dividend yield + dividend growth rate
    - The average dividend growth rate for the U.S since 1870 has been about 1.5% per year. The US economy has grown at about 3% during this time. The difference can be explained by share dilution.
    - This explains why some fast-growing emerging markets can actually be bad investments. If total share dilution is growing faster than they economy, you will have a negative return
    - Don&#39;t use past returns in your estimates. Use the Gordon equation.
-	Homes are NOT investments. At best you will get a real 1% return after factoring in maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc., and more likely 0%. It is a place to live and nothing more.
-	One way to calculate a home&#39;s fair market value is to take the estimated rental and multiply it by 150. Example - $2,500 rent x 150 = fair value of $375,000

4 Pillars

Math – Chapter 2

-	DR – Discount Rate – Amount we expect to get from the market. IE 8% Return
-	Two times this century, investors have demanded a 15% DR.
-	High DR = high perceived risk, high returns, depressed stock price
-	Low DR = low perceived risk, low returns, elevated stock price
-	PV – Present Value
-	DR and PV are inversely related. Higher DR = Lower PV or Lower DR = Higher PV
-	The risker the situation, the higher the DR we demand, and the less that asset is worth to us
-	Food companies DR is lower because their earnings/dividends are more stable. Compare this to the DR of an auto company who has a higher DR because their earnings are more erratic. This is why cyclical companies with erratic earnings sell cheaper than say food companies
-	It is impossible to do this with a single security. Because if the company falters, then your math will be off. But for the market as a whole. It will work because it evens out. The income stream of the market as a whole is more reliable. You can also use this formula in reverse.
  - Fisher&#39;s Dividend Discount Method (DDM) - Market Value = Present Dividend / (DR - Dividend Growth Rate)
-	Historic DGR is 4.5 - 5%
-	The above equation does not predict the short-term future. You can make it say whatever you want. One book even predicted a 36,000 Dow based on this formula in 2000
-	Gordon Equation – As close to financial law as you can get. Accurate way to predict long term stock returns (20-30 Years)
  - DR (Market Return) = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth
-	This formula has been extremely accurate. It predicted a 9% (4.5% Yield + 4.5% Growth) growth the last century and the actual growth was 9.89%.
-	If a company doesn&#39;t pay dividends, their long-term return would roughly be the same as their aggregate earnings growth. IE – 10% earnings growth would get 10% return. But the long-term average corporate earnings and dividends growth is 5% and has not changed in 100 years.
-	Remember, if the average annualized earnings growth is about 5%, the annualized stock price increase must be very close to this number. Unless they are buying shares or selling shares. Then the growth rate will increase or decrease by that amount. IE – company has 5% growth and bought back 5% of outstanding shares = 10% growth. Or company has 5% growth and sells 5% of outstanding shares = 0% growth. But for the market as a whole, this evens out.
-	Gordon Equation works with bonds too. You just put the DGR at 0. Market Return = Dividend Yield
-	Over short periods (less than 20 years) changes in the dividend yield or PE multiple account for most of the stock markets return. This is the &quot;speculative return&quot; of the market. The short-term return of the market is purely speculative and cannot be predicted.
-	Long term increases in the stock market value is entirely the result of long term dividend growth and dividend yield calculated from the Gordon Equation or &quot;fundamental return&quot; of the market
-	Ralph Wanger analogy of the market = The market is a very excitable dog on a very long leash in NYC, darting randomly in every direction. The dog&#39;s owner is walking from Columbus Circle, through Central Park, to the Met. At any moment, the is no predicting which way the dog will lurch. But in the long run, you know he is headed Northeast at 3 mph. The problem is that almost all of the market players have their eye on the dog and not the owner.
-	If public confidence is low, DR will rise and asset prices will fall, which will increase subsequent returns. The opposite is also true. This means the worst possible time to invest is when the skies are the clearest. The best possible time to invest is when the skies are darkest. You are going to be investing against the grain if you want good returns.
-	DR seems quite sensitive to prior stock market returns. This means a rising stock market lowers DR and perceived risks which drives up prices. Then you get the vicious cycle. The same thing happens in reverse during recessions/depressions.
-	The immediate past is not predictive of the future
-	Asset classes have a tendency to revert to their mean over periods longer than 3 years
-	Mean revision means that periods of relatively good performance tend to be followed by periods of relatively poor performance. The opposite is also true. But this is not a sure thing.
-	1993 Fuller study showed that popular growth stocks with high P/E ratios increased their earnings 10% faster than the market in year 1, 3% faster in year 2, 2% faster in year 3 and 4 and 1% in years 5 and 6. Eventually their high P/E ratios come down and with it their returns. In other words, you can expect a growth stock to increase its earnings, on average, about 20% more than the market over 6 years.
-	Example of above – and why you don&#39;t invest in growth stocks
  - Smokestack has a P/E of 20 and Glamour has a P/E of 80
    - For every $100 of Smokestack stock it earns $5. 100/20 = 5
    - For every $100 of Glamour stock it earns $1.25. 100/80 = 1.25
    - If SS grows its earnings at 6% for 6 years it will increase earnings by 48% from $5 per share to $7.40 per share
    - If Glamour grows is earnings 20% faster than the market over 6 years. It will increase earnings by 78%. 1.48 x 1.20 = 1.78. So, its earnings will grow from $1.25 to $2.23. After that it will have the same earnings growth as SS. The market will see the earnings slowing down and clobber its shareholders
-	There are no patterns to the market. You can&#39;t predict them. Just because the market behaved a certain way one time doesn&#39;t mean it will repeat
-	If history did repeat itself, the wealthiest investors would be librarians
-	There are some pieces of data that have worth. Like housing starts or the length of the average industrial working week. The problem is that everyone knows this information too and it is already being factored into the stock and bond prices. Something that everyone knows isn&#39;t worth knowing yourself.

Rational Expectations

- Irving Fisher noted that the value of any investment was simply the stream of future dividends, discounted by the risk adjusted expected rate of return
  1. Return = Current dividend yield + historical dividend growth rate
  2. R = Yield + G
- For the last 150 years, after inflation (Real) dividend growth is about 1.5%
- If dividend on the S+P 500 is 2% for example then add the real dividend growth rate of 1.5% = 3.5% expected real return
- This is what Vanguard founder John Bogle called the fundamental return of the market.
- The other part of the return is the &quot;speculative return&quot;
  1. Return = Dividend yield + Growth + Speculative return
  2. &quot;Speculative Return&quot; is due to change in short term valuations of stocks (P/E&#39;s, etc.)
- Over short periods, the speculative returns are the driver of stock returns. But over long terms, it is the fundamental return that is key.
- Your job as an investor is to (as best you can) ignore the speculative return (Short Term) in order to earn the fundamental return (Long Term)
- No one knows what the speculative return will be and if they did, they wouldn&#39;t tell anyone
- Shiller&#39;s CAPE 10 ratio is another great way to estimate returns
- The fair value CAPE 10 ratio is probably about 20. Up from its historic 16.5
- Just like the P/E average is around 20, up from its historic 15.
- A rebalancing bonus can among stock asset classes can be viewed as a kind of risk premium for betting that stock asset classes will revert to the mean and produce similar long-term returns
- In other words, Asset class returns tend to revert to the mean or there would be no rebalancing bonus

IAA

- The best way to estimate future stock returns is the DDM (Dividend Discount Method)
  - Return = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth Rate + Multiple Change
    - Dividend yield is the yield on the investment (Example – 2020 S+P 500 yield is 1.5%). The Dividend growth rate is historically 5%. And the Multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall P/E ratio.
    - The Dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). The Multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).
- An optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. This is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to &quot;mean revert&quot;.
  - Don&#39;t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. We can&#39;t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. And if we could, we wouldn&#39;t need one anyway.
    - And optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house
- A well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. It does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. You will still suffer loss from time to time
  - The benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. Thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market
- Stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy
  - But then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (Growth Stocks)
- Long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive
- Paul Miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the Dow P/E strategy. He examined buying the 10 lowest P/E stocks in the Dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest P/E stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest P/E stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed

- Dividend Discount Method (DDM) formulated by John Burr Williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. Since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.
  - And since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won&#39;t receive it today.
    - The reduction is called the Discount Rate (DR)
      - The DR is determined by the cost of money (Risk Free Rate) plus the risk to the lender
        - Safer investments have a lower DR and risker investments a higher DR
      - DR can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset
        - Lower risks = lower DR = Lower expected return/Higher Present Value
        - Higher risks = higher DR = Higher expected return/Lower Present Value
      - Formula – Reasonable Price = (Annual Dividend Amount)/(DR – Dividend Growth Rate)
        - But you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. So be careful with this formula

Asset Allocation

- A research firm did an analysis on inflows and outflows (1986-2005) from equity mutual fund investors, it showed that the average investor earned just 3.9% vs 11.9% for the S+P 500
  - Why? Mostly due to chasing the performance of funds that had recently done well
  - Investment return is far more dependent on investor behavior than on fund performance
- Research studies repeatedly show that most money managers underperform the market
  - Professionals populate the marketplace and by definition, the majority cannot outperform the average. And this will continue to be true
- Some managers with superior skill do exist, the problem is they are rare and very difficult to identify conclusively
- Modern Portfolio Theory considers each asset class not as an end in itself but rather as it stands in relationship to all others in the portfolio
- No liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes
- Simple Average Return vs Compound Annual Return
  - Example – If I invest $100 and I get a 25% return year 1 and a -20% return in year 2.
    - Simple average return (Arithmetic return) is 2.5%. 25%-20%/2 = 2.5%
    - Compound Annual Return (Geometric return) - $100 x 25% = $125 x -20% = $100 or 0%
      - For any series of returns, the simple average return will ALWAYS be higher or equal to the compound annual return
      - The difference between the simple average and compound annual is larger for highly volatile returns.
      - Only in a situation where returns are consistent will the returns be equal
        - The reason in the disparity is that it requires a larger percentage of above average performance to offset a given percentage of below average performance
          - Simple average is ok to use in a single period
          - Compound return is more appropriate to use when comparing returns over multiple periods
- You should be concerned not only about an asset class historical return but also about the dispersion of those returns and the likelihood that future returns will be higher or lower than past returns
  - People often anchor their return expectation to an investments long term historical return. The average return could be an unlikely result
- The TIPS spread provides a market-concensus forecast of future inflation
  - Equal to the difference between the yield to maturity of a conventional treasury bond and the yield to maturity of a similar TIPS bond
- The median normalized P/E ratio for 1926-2011 is 16.45
  - Higher current P/E ratios signal lower future returns
  - Lower current P/E ratios signal higher future returns
  - But there is a range to these outcomes
  - P/E ratio and 10-year returns following
    - Below 9 = Average 15.09%
    - 9-11 = Average 15.40%
    - 11-14 = Average 12.99%
    - 14-18 = Average 10.9%
    - 18-25 = Average 6.46%
    - 25+ = Average 3.07%
      - Range was -1% on the low to 6% on the high
- Market timing doesn&#39;t exist, but people want to believe it is possible
- Over 11 cycles post WWII
  - Median bull market was up 79%, bear market was down 28%
  - Median bull market lasted 2.5x as long as the median bear market
- A study by Robert Jeffrey concluded: No one can predict the market&#39;s ups and downs over a long period, and the risks of trying outweigh the rewards
  - Most of the &quot;positive action&quot; in stocks in compressed into just a few periods, which (perversely but understandably) tend to follow particularly adverse times for stocks
- Much of the problem with market timing is that a disproportionate % of the total gain from a bull market tends to occur very rapidly at the beginning of a market recovery
- Percent you must be right to make marking timing a viable strategy
  - 80% bull and 50% bear
  - 70% bull and 80% bear
  - 60% bull and 90% bear
- Do not invest in stocks unless you are in it for the long run
- Most people do not think in terms of expected returns and standard deviation.
  - They think in terms of the chance of loss
- For any series of returns, the larger the standard deviation, the more the compound annual returns (geometric) drop below the simple average return
  - Volatility therefore impairs the compounding of returns
  - If I have 2 investments, both with the same 10% simple average return and one has a higher standard deviation than the other, the investment with the higher standard deviation will have a lower compound annual return.
- An ideal investment would be inversely correlated assets with similar returns. But they don&#39;t exist in real life.
  - If you had 2 investments with 10% simple average return and a negative correlation, the compound annual return would be 10% also.
    - This doesn&#39;t exist though in real life; it would be too good to be true
- Most investments in real life that have similar return patterns have a slightly positive correlation to each other. Although differing in degree, most financial classes are positively correlated to each other
  - If you have 2 portfolios with the same 10% simple average return, the one with the lower volatility will have the higher compound annual return.
- Having assets with similar return profiles and slightly positive correlations will reduce standard deviation and therefore improve the compound annual return of the portfolio. Even if the correlation is just mostly or slightly positive, it still provides a benefit
- Historic data is helpful in understanding asset class volatility and return characteristics and relationships. But precise answers to future portfolio AA decisions simply are not possible. The perfect AA is not possible except in retrospect
- A portfolio that minimizes portfolio volatility for a given expected return or maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk is said to be efficient

A Random Walk Down Wall Street

- Technical analyst looks at charts and patterns (They don&#39;t exist). They believe the market is 10% logical and 90% psychological and attempt to beat the crowd with their picks. Does not work.
- Fundamental analyst believe that the market is 90% logical and 10% psychological. Caring little for patterns and past price movements. Fundamentalists seek to determine a stocks proper value. Value applies to assets, growth rates, earnings and dividends, interest rate, and risks. They believe that the company&#39;s price will eventually reflect its real worth
- God Almighty does not know the proper P/E multiple for a common stock
- The history of stock price movement contains no useful information that will enable an investor to consistently to outperform a buy and hold strategy
- Technical analysis strategies are usually amusing, often comforting, but of no real value
- The past history of stock prices cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way
- Technical analysis enriches people marketing them, not investors
- The idea is simple, if past prices contain little to no useful information for the prediction of future prices, there is no point in following any technical trading rule for the timing of purchases or sales. A simple policy of buying and holding will be at least as good as any technical procedure. Also, buying and selling short term generate taxable events, brokerage charges, and spreads that decrease returns
- Analysts&#39; recommendations are tainted by very profitable investment banking relationships
- Brad Barber studied the performance of the &quot;strong buy&quot; recommendations and found the results were terrible
- Systemic Risk AKA &quot;Market Risk&quot; – arises from the basic variability of stock prices in general and the tendency for all stocks to go along with the general market, at least to some extent. Cannot be eliminated by diversification
- Unsystematic Risk – results from factors peculiar to that specific company. IE – strikes, new products, management, etc. This can be eliminated through adequate diversification. With as few as 60 stocks.
- Beta – relative volatility or sensitivity to market moves
  - Numerical description of systemic risk
  - It is a comparison between the movements of an individual stock or portfolio and the movements of the market as a whole
  - IE – the total stock market has a Beta of 1. If a stock has a Beta of 2. It will move up or down 2x as much as the total market. +-10% change in the total market would mean a +-20% change for the stock. Beta of 0.5 would be +-5%
- Investors will not be paid for bearing risks that can be diversified away. The is the logic behind the capital asset pricing model
- As the systemic risk (Beta) of an individual portfolio increases, so does the return an investor can expect
- Beta isn&#39;t the end all be all though. Fama and French did a study in 1992 that discovered that there was no relationship between returns for portfolios and their beta measures. It is not a useful single measure to capture the relationship between risk and return
- It appears that the only way to obtain higher long-run investment returns is to accept greater risks
- Unfortunately, a perfect risk measure doesn&#39;t exist. Beta and rate of return has not corresponded to the relationship predicted in theory. Beta can also change.
- In the short run, change in valuations can have a major role in determining returns. IE – P/E&#39;s and Dividend yields
- P/E have varied widely. During the early 2000&#39;s with high optimism, the P/E&#39;s were about 30. During 1982 stocks sold at only a P/E of 8
- P/E go up with lower interest rates and go down with higher interest rates because now equities have to compete with bonds

Stocks for the Long Run

- Real stock returns in the 19th century do not differ appreciably from the real returns in the 20th century
- Stocks fluctuate both below and above the trendline but eventually return to the trend. AKA mean reversion. This means that periods of above average returns tend to be followed by periods of below average returns and vice versa
- In the short run, stock returns are very volatile driven by changes in earnings, interest rates, risk, uncertainty and psychological factors
- The stock market has real annualized returns of 6.7% from 1802-1870, 6.6% from 1871-1925, and 6.4% from 1926-2012. This is remarkable constancy
- As stable as the long-term returns for equities have been, the same cannot be said of fixed-income investments. Real returns on treasures were 5.1% in the early 19th century to a bare 0.6% since 1926, only slightly above inflation
- Real return on bonds have shown a similar but more moderate decline as fixed-income. 4.8% in the first period to 3.7% in the 2nd period and now only 2.6% in the current period.
- The excess return of stocks over bonds is referred to as the equity risk premium.
- Subtracting stock and bond returns from equity shows that the premium has averaged 3% against bonds and 3.9% over treasury bills over the last 200 years.
- 19 countries were analyzed from 1900-2012 and it was determined that the US experience of equites outperforming bonds and bills has been mirrored in all countries examined. Every country achieved equity performance that was better than bonds.
- While the US and UK have performed well, that is no indication that they are out of line with other countries. Therefore, studies on the US market results have relevance to all investors in all countries
- Swings in investor sentiment from political or economic crisis can throw stocks off their long-term path, but the fundamental forces producing economic growth have always enabled equities to regain their long-term trend
- Correlations between asset classes can and do change over time
- During 20 year holding periods, stock have never fallen below inflation. Bond and treasury bills have lagged by as much as 3% below inflation
- The worst 30-year timeframe since 1802 stocks beat inflation by 2.6%.
- As the holding period increases, the odds that stocks will beat bonds or bills increase drastically
- On any given 2-year cycle, there is a 33% chance bonds or bills will beat stocks
- Under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds
- Because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again
- Real returns (post tax) since 1913 (income tax enacted) have ranged from 6.1%-2.7% on stocks, 2.2% to -0.3% for bonds and bills having a 0.4% to -2.3%
- Taxes have the greatest impact on fixed income investments
- Since 1871, for someone in the highest tax bracket, short term treasury bills have had a negative real return after tax
- The inflation tax hits harder when the holding period is shorter. The more you buy and sell, the more frequently the government can tax the gains, which might not be real after inflation
- P/E ratio is the ratio of a stock&#39;s price to its earnings. The average P/E is 15 from 1871-2012
- Earnings yield is important also. It measures the earnings generated per dollar of stock market value. IE – if the P/E of the market is 15 means the earnings yield is 1/15 or 6.67% which is historically accurate long-term rate of return on stocks. This is not a coincidence. If the P/E went to 20 it would be 1/20 or 5%.
- But there have been changes in the economy and markets that may rise the average P/E in the future. These changes include a decrease in the cost of investing in indexes, a lower discount rate, and an increase in knowledge about the advantages of equity vs fixed income investing.
- There are many reasons for a decline in real returns available to investors. Whatever the reasons, such a decline implies that the real return on equity need not be as high as it had historically been to attract investors. The historic equity risk premium was 3-3.5%. If we assume the long-run real rate is somewhere around 2%, then a 3% equity premium will require a 5% real return on stocks, which, gives us an average P/E of 20. 1/20 = 5%
- Transaction costs have come down and this has led to a higher P/E ratio than in the past
- The equity risk premium also itself may have shrunk. There is considerable truth in the statement that widespread knowledge of the profitability of common stocks, gained from the studies that have been made, tends to diminish the likelihood that correspondingly large profits can be gained from stocks in the future. The competitive bidding for stocks causes prices at the time of purchase to be high
- Investors are drawn to firms able to generate high earnings and revenue growth. But empirical data shows this pursuit of growth often leads to subpar returns. IE – IBM vs Exxon 1950-2012. Exxon was a better investment
- Financial theory has shown that if capital markets are &quot;efficient&quot; in the sense that known valuation criteria, such as earnings, dividends, cash flows, book values, and other factors are already factored into the security price, investing on the basis of these fundamentals will not improve returns.
- In an efficient market, the only way investors can consistently earn higher returns is to undertake higher risk, where risk is defined as the correlation of an asset&#39;s return with the overall stock market. This was the basis for the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or Beta
- Beta and CAPM was the primary basis for stock returns in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s. Unfortunately, beta and CAPM did not prove effective in explaining the differences in returns among individual stocks
- Don&#39;t use Beta to try to buy stocks, it doesn&#39;t work
- Fama and French wrote an article that showed there are 2 factors (size and value) that are far more important in determining a stock return that the beta of a stock
- Although the historical return on small stocks has outpaced large stocks since 1926, the magnitude of small cap outperformance has waxed and waned unpredictably.
- The existence of a small-cap premium does not mean they will outperform large stock every year or even every decade. They have lost to large cap for more than a decade before.
- F+F also determined that value played a role in returns. Stocks with low prices relative to their fundamentals are value stocks. Stocks with high prices relative to their fundamentals are growth stocks
- In 1978 Ramaswamy and Litzenberger established a significant correlation between dividend yield and subsequent return. O&#39;Shaughnessy has shown that in the period of 1951-1994, the 50 highest dividend yielding large cap stocks had a return that was 1.7% higher than the market
- Basu did some studies in the 1960&#39;s that showed that stocks with lower P/E ratios have significantly higher returns than stocks with high P/E ratios, even after accounting for risks
- Graham wrote in Security Analysis (1940) that people who habitually pay more than 16x average earnings are likely to lose considerable money in the long run
- P/B ratio is a good ratio but there are conceptual problems with using book value as a value criterion. It does not correct for changes in the market value of assets, not does it capitalize R+D expenditures. From 1987-2012 the author determined that book value underperformed either dividend yields or P/E ratios in explaining returns
- The worst course an investor can take is to follow the prevailing sentiment about economic activity. That will lead investors to buy at high prices when times are good and everyone is optimistic and sell at the low
- Since 1885, there have been 145 days where the market moved 5% or more. Only ¼ of those days can be attributed to an event. This confirms the unpredictability of the market and the difficulty in forecasting moves
- News moves markets. But the timing of much news is unpredictable, like wars, political developments, and natural disasters
- Markets do not",,,,,,
directly respond to what is announced, rather, they respond to the difference between what the traders expect to happen and what actually happens. The market already incorporates all the information that was expected,,,,,,,
- For example – a strong economic report can send stocks down. Why? Because even though the news is good for main street and corporate earnings, it can mean the federal reserve will raise interest rates, which raises the discount rate at which these future profits are discounted,,,,,,,

- P/E ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. IE = P/E of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. Ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.,,,,,,,,,

-	buffet – newtons 4th law of motion. investor return decrease as motion increases.
-	winning strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever
-	the index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. only stock market risk remains, which is large
-	the returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market
-	active investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.
-	the stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. but this goes up and down in cycles. as investors are willing to pay higher or lower p/e.
-	investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. about 9.5% for the last 100 years
-	reversions to the mean – tendency for p/e ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.
-	economics controls the long-term stock market return. emotions control the short term. accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible
-	investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, before the costs of investing are deducted – when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees – the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. the lower these costs the better
  - assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. ie - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%
-	most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. investors chase past performance.
-	as the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.
-	picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty
-	over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?
  - bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years

all about asset allocation

- as a nation, we are not saving enough in retirement accounts to make up for diminishing social security benefits and other traditional sources of income
  - it is unreliable to assume that managers who have beaten the market in the past will continue to do so over the long term
- on any given year, the index fund will be beat by many active managed funds. but in the long run, the index fund will be at the top
- earnings growth (corporate earnings or gdp) +dividend (yield)+speculation (p/e ratio) = market return
- in the short run, speculation creates the volatility in stock prices, but in the long term, economic growth is the real driver of returns. you can&#39;t guess what p/e ratio the market will assign in the future so don&#39;t try

the investors manifesto

- gordon&#39;s equation
    - expected return = dividend yield + dividend growth rate
    - the average dividend growth rate for the u.s since 1870 has been about 1.5% per year. the us economy has grown at about 3% during this time. the difference can be explained by share dilution.
    - this explains why some fast-growing emerging markets can actually be bad investments. if total share dilution is growing faster than they economy, you will have a negative return
    - don&#39;t use past returns in your estimates. use the gordon equation.
-	homes are not investments. at best you will get a real 1% return after factoring in maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc., and more likely 0%. it is a place to live and nothing more.
-	one way to calculate a home&#39;s fair market value is to take the estimated rental and multiply it by 150. example - $2,500 rent x 150 = fair value of $375,000

4 pillars

math – chapter 2

-	dr – discount rate – amount we expect to get from the market. ie 8% return
-	two times this century, investors have demanded a 15% dr.
-	high dr = high perceived risk, high returns, depressed stock price
-	low dr = low perceived risk, low returns, elevated stock price
-	pv – present value
-	dr and pv are inversely related. higher dr = lower pv or lower dr = higher pv
-	the risker the situation, the higher the dr we demand, and the less that asset is worth to us
-	food companies dr is lower because their earnings/dividends are more stable. compare this to the dr of an auto company who has a higher dr because their earnings are more erratic. this is why cyclical companies with erratic earnings sell cheaper than say food companies
-	it is impossible to do this with a single security. because if the company falters, then your math will be off. but for the market as a whole. it will work because it evens out. the income stream of the market as a whole is more reliable. you can also use this formula in reverse.
  - fisher&#39;s dividend discount method (ddm) - market value = present dividend / (dr - dividend growth rate)
-	historic dgr is 4.5 - 5%
-	the above equation does not predict the short-term future. you can make it say whatever you want. one book even predicted a 36,000 dow based on this formula in 2000
-	gordon equation – as close to financial law as you can get. accurate way to predict long term stock returns (20-30 years)
  - dr (market return) = dividend yield + earnings growth
-	this formula has been extremely accurate. it predicted a 9% (4.5% yield + 4.5% growth) growth the last century and the actual growth was 9.89%.
-	if a company doesn&#39;t pay dividends, their long-term return would roughly be the same as their aggregate earnings growth. ie – 10% earnings growth would get 10% return. but the long-term average corporate earnings and dividends growth is 5% and has not changed in 100 years.
-	remember, if the average annualized earnings growth is about 5%, the annualized stock price increase must be very close to this number. unless they are buying shares or selling shares. then the growth rate will increase or decrease by that amount. ie – company has 5% growth and bought back 5% of outstanding shares = 10% growth. or company has 5% growth and sells 5% of outstanding shares = 0% growth. but for the market as a whole, this evens out.
-	gordon equation works with bonds too. you just put the dgr at 0. market return = dividend yield
-	over short periods (less than 20 years) changes in the dividend yield or pe multiple account for most of the stock markets return. this is the &quot;speculative return&quot; of the market. the short-term return of the market is purely speculative and cannot be predicted.
-	long term increases in the stock market value is entirely the result of long term dividend growth and dividend yield calculated from the gordon equation or &quot;fundamental return&quot; of the market
-	ralph wanger analogy of the market = the market is a very excitable dog on a very long leash in nyc, darting randomly in every direction. the dog&#39;s owner is walking from columbus circle, through central park, to the met. at any moment, the is no predicting which way the dog will lurch. but in the long run, you know he is headed northeast at 3 mph. the problem is that almost all of the market players have their eye on the dog and not the owner.
-	if public confidence is low, dr will rise and asset prices will fall, which will increase subsequent returns. the opposite is also true. this means the worst possible time to invest is when the skies are the clearest. the best possible time to invest is when the skies are darkest. you are going to be investing against the grain if you want good returns.
-	dr seems quite sensitive to prior stock market returns. this means a rising stock market lowers dr and perceived risks which drives up prices. then you get the vicious cycle. the same thing happens in reverse during recessions/depressions.
-	the immediate past is not predictive of the future
-	asset classes have a tendency to revert to their mean over periods longer than 3 years
-	mean revision means that periods of relatively good performance tend to be followed by periods of relatively poor performance. the opposite is also true. but this is not a sure thing.
-	1993 fuller study showed that popular growth stocks with high p/e ratios increased their earnings 10% faster than the market in year 1, 3% faster in year 2, 2% faster in year 3 and 4 and 1% in years 5 and 6. eventually their high p/e ratios come down and with it their returns. in other words, you can expect a growth stock to increase its earnings, on average, about 20% more than the market over 6 years.
-	example of above – and why you don&#39;t invest in growth stocks
  - smokestack has a p/e of 20 and glamour has a p/e of 80
    - for every $100 of smokestack stock it earns $5. 100/20 = 5
    - for every $100 of glamour stock it earns $1.25. 100/80 = 1.25
    - if ss grows its earnings at 6% for 6 years it will increase earnings by 48% from $5 per share to $7.40 per share
    - if glamour grows is earnings 20% faster than the market over 6 years. it will increase earnings by 78%. 1.48 x 1.20 = 1.78. so, its earnings will grow from $1.25 to $2.23. after that it will have the same earnings growth as ss. the market will see the earnings slowing down and clobber its shareholders
-	there are no patterns to the market. you can&#39;t predict them. just because the market behaved a certain way one time doesn&#39;t mean it will repeat
-	if history did repeat itself, the wealthiest investors would be librarians
-	there are some pieces of data that have worth. like housing starts or the length of the average industrial working week. the problem is that everyone knows this information too and it is already being factored into the stock and bond prices. something that everyone knows isn&#39;t worth knowing yourself.

rational expectations

- irving fisher noted that the value of any investment was simply the stream of future dividends, discounted by the risk adjusted expected rate of return
  1. return = current dividend yield + historical dividend growth rate
  2. r = yield + g
- for the last 150 years, after inflation (real) dividend growth is about 1.5%
- if dividend on the s+p 500 is 2% for example then add the real dividend growth rate of 1.5% = 3.5% expected real return
- this is what vanguard founder john bogle called the fundamental return of the market.
- the other part of the return is the &quot;speculative return&quot;
  1. return = dividend yield + growth + speculative return
  2. &quot;speculative return&quot; is due to change in short term valuations of stocks (p/e&#39;s, etc.)
- over short periods, the speculative returns are the driver of stock returns. but over long terms, it is the fundamental return that is key.
- your job as an investor is to (as best you can) ignore the speculative return (short term) in order to earn the fundamental return (long term)
- no one knows what the speculative return will be and if they did, they wouldn&#39;t tell anyone
- shiller&#39;s cape 10 ratio is another great way to estimate returns
- the fair value cape 10 ratio is probably about 20. up from its historic 16.5
- just like the p/e average is around 20, up from its historic 15.
- a rebalancing bonus can among stock asset classes can be viewed as a kind of risk premium for betting that stock asset classes will revert to the mean and produce similar long-term returns
- in other words, asset class returns tend to revert to the mean or there would be no rebalancing bonus

iaa

- the best way to estimate future stock returns is the ddm (dividend discount method)
  - return = dividend yield + dividend growth rate + multiple change
    - dividend yield is the yield on the investment (example – 2020 s+p 500 yield is 1.5%). the dividend growth rate is historically 5%. and the multiple change refers to the increase or decrease in the overall p/e ratio.
    - the dividend yield and dividend growth rate is the fundamental return (easy to estimate). the multiple change is the speculative return (impossible to estimate).
- an optimizer will heavily favor those assets with high historical or assumed returns. this is a problem because asset returns have a tendency to &quot;mean revert&quot;.
  - don&#39;t use an optimizer to try to develop an asset allocation. we can&#39;t predict returns, standard deviations, or correlations accurately enough. and if we could, we wouldn&#39;t need one anyway.
    - and optimizing historic returns is a one-way ticket to the poor house
- a well-diversified portfolio is not a free lunch. it does not come anywhere near eliminating risk. you will still suffer loss from time to time
  - the benefit is also psychological because you are getting into the habit of buying low and selling high. thus, profiting by moving in the opposite direction of the market
- stocks outperform almost all other assets in the long run because you are buying a piece of our almost constantly growing economy
  - but then investors make the mistake of thinking the most profitable stocks to own must be those of the most rapidly growing companies (growth stocks)
- long term returns are usually higher when valuations are cheap and lower when they are expensive
- paul miller did the first study on cheap stocks called the dow p/e strategy. he examined buying the 10 lowest p/e stocks in the dow from 1936-1964 and discovered that the lowest p/e stocks (those everyone hates) actually outperformed the market and the highest p/e stocks (those everyone loves) greatly underperformed

- dividend discount method (ddm) formulated by john burr williams in 1938 was formulated by a simple idea. since all companies eventually go bankrupt, the value of a stock, bond or the entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present.
  - and since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, its value must be reduced or discounted to reflect the fact you won&#39;t receive it today.
    - the reduction is called the discount rate (dr)
      - the dr is determined by the cost of money (risk free rate) plus the risk to the lender
        - safer investments have a lower dr and risker investments a higher dr
      - dr can also be thought of as the expected return of the asset
        - lower risks = lower dr = lower expected return/higher present value
        - higher risks = higher dr = higher expected return/lower present value
      - formula – reasonable price = (annual dividend amount)/(dr – dividend growth rate)
        - but you can make this formula say anything you want depending on your inputs. so be careful with this formula

asset allocation

- a research firm did an analysis on inflows and outflows (1986-2005) from equity mutual fund investors, it showed that the average investor earned just 3.9% vs 11.9% for the s+p 500
  - why? mostly due to chasing the performance of funds that had recently done well
  - investment return is far more dependent on investor behavior than on fund performance
- research studies repeatedly show that most money managers underperform the market
  - professionals populate the marketplace and by definition, the majority cannot outperform the average. and this will continue to be true
- some managers with superior skill do exist, the problem is they are rare and very difficult to identify conclusively
- modern portfolio theory considers each asset class not as an end in itself but rather as it stands in relationship to all others in the portfolio
- no liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes
- simple average return vs compound annual return
  - example – if i invest $100 and i get a 25% return year 1 and a -20% return in year 2.
    - simple average return (arithmetic return) is 2.5%. 25%-20%/2 = 2.5%
    - compound annual return (geometric return) - $100 x 25% = $125 x -20% = $100 or 0%
      - for any series of returns, the simple average return will always be higher or equal to the compound annual return
      - the difference between the simple average and compound annual is larger for highly volatile returns.
      - only in a situation where returns are consistent will the returns be equal
        - the reason in the disparity is that it requires a larger percentage of above average performance to offset a given percentage of below average performance
          - simple average is ok to use in a single period
          - compound return is more appropriate to use when comparing returns over multiple periods
- you should be concerned not only about an asset class historical return but also about the dispersion of those returns and the likelihood that future returns will be higher or lower than past returns
  - people often anchor their return expectation to an investments long term historical return. the average return could be an unlikely result
- the tips spread provides a market-concensus forecast of future inflation
  - equal to the difference between the yield to maturity of a conventional treasury bond and the yield to maturity of a similar tips bond
- the median normalized p/e ratio for 1926-2011 is 16.45
  - higher current p/e ratios signal lower future returns
  - lower current p/e ratios signal higher future returns
  - but there is a range to these outcomes
  - p/e ratio and 10-year returns following
    - below 9 = average 15.09%
    - 9-11 = average 15.40%
    - 11-14 = average 12.99%
    - 14-18 = average 10.9%
    - 18-25 = average 6.46%
    - 25+ = average 3.07%
      - range was -1% on the low to 6% on the high
- market timing doesn&#39;t exist, but people want to believe it is possible
- over 11 cycles post wwii
  - median bull market was up 79%, bear market was down 28%
  - median bull market lasted 2.5x as long as the median bear market
- a study by robert jeffrey concluded: no one can predict the market&#39;s ups and downs over a long period, and the risks of trying outweigh the rewards
  - most of the &quot;positive action&quot; in stocks in compressed into just a few periods, which (perversely but understandably) tend to follow particularly adverse times for stocks
- much of the problem with market timing is that a disproportionate % of the total gain from a bull market tends to occur very rapidly at the beginning of a market recovery
- percent you must be right to make marking timing a viable strategy
  - 80% bull and 50% bear
  - 70% bull and 80% bear
  - 60% bull and 90% bear
- do not invest in stocks unless you are in it for the long run
- most people do not think in terms of expected returns and standard deviation.
  - they think in terms of the chance of loss
- for any series of returns, the larger the standard deviation, the more the compound annual returns (geometric) drop below the simple average return
  - volatility therefore impairs the compounding of returns
  - if i have 2 investments, both with the same 10% simple average return and one has a higher standard deviation than the other, the investment with the higher standard deviation will have a lower compound annual return.
- an ideal investment would be inversely correlated assets with similar returns. but they don&#39;t exist in real life.
  - if you had 2 investments with 10% simple average return and a negative correlation, the compound annual return would be 10% also.
    - this doesn&#39;t exist though in real life; it would be too good to be true
- most investments in real life that have similar return patterns have a slightly positive correlation to each other. although differing in degree, most financial classes are positively correlated to each other
  - if you have 2 portfolios with the same 10% simple average return, the one with the lower volatility will have the higher compound annual return.
- having assets with similar return profiles and slightly positive correlations will reduce standard deviation and therefore improve the compound annual return of the portfolio. even if the correlation is just mostly or slightly positive, it still provides a benefit
- historic data is helpful in understanding asset class volatility and return characteristics and relationships. but precise answers to future portfolio aa decisions simply are not possible. the perfect aa is not possible except in retrospect
- a portfolio that minimizes portfolio volatility for a given expected return or maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk is said to be efficient

a random walk down wall street

- technical analyst looks at charts and patterns (they don&#39;t exist). they believe the market is 10% logical and 90% psychological and attempt to beat the crowd with their picks. does not work.
- fundamental analyst believe that the market is 90% logical and 10% psychological. caring little for patterns and past price movements. fundamentalists seek to determine a stocks proper value. value applies to assets, growth rates, earnings and dividends, interest rate, and risks. they believe that the company&#39;s price will eventually reflect its real worth
- god almighty does not know the proper p/e multiple for a common stock
- the history of stock price movement contains no useful information that will enable an investor to consistently to outperform a buy and hold strategy
- technical analysis strategies are usually amusing, often comforting, but of no real value
- the past history of stock prices cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way
- technical analysis enriches people marketing them, not investors
- the idea is simple, if past prices contain little to no useful information for the prediction of future prices, there is no point in following any technical trading rule for the timing of purchases or sales. a simple policy of buying and holding will be at least as good as any technical procedure. also, buying and selling short term generate taxable events, brokerage charges, and spreads that decrease returns
- analysts&#39; recommendations are tainted by very profitable investment banking relationships
- brad barber studied the performance of the &quot;strong buy&quot; recommendations and found the results were terrible
- systemic risk aka &quot;market risk&quot; – arises from the basic variability of stock prices in general and the tendency for all stocks to go along with the general market, at least to some extent. cannot be eliminated by diversification
- unsystematic risk – results from factors peculiar to that specific company. ie – strikes, new products, management, etc. this can be eliminated through adequate diversification. with as few as 60 stocks.
- beta – relative volatility or sensitivity to market moves
  - numerical description of systemic risk
  - it is a comparison between the movements of an individual stock or portfolio and the movements of the market as a whole
  - ie – the total stock market has a beta of 1. if a stock has a beta of 2. it will move up or down 2x as much as the total market. +-10% change in the total market would mean a +-20% change for the stock. beta of 0.5 would be +-5%
- investors will not be paid for bearing risks that can be diversified away. the is the logic behind the capital asset pricing model
- as the systemic risk (beta) of an individual portfolio increases, so does the return an investor can expect
- beta isn&#39;t the end all be all though. fama and french did a study in 1992 that discovered that there was no relationship between returns for portfolios and their beta measures. it is not a useful single measure to capture the relationship between risk and return
- it appears that the only way to obtain higher long-run investment returns is to accept greater risks
- unfortunately, a perfect risk measure doesn&#39;t exist. beta and rate of return has not corresponded to the relationship predicted in theory. beta can also change.
- in the short run, change in valuations can have a major role in determining returns. ie – p/e&#39;s and dividend yields
- p/e have varied widely. during the early 2000&#39;s with high optimism, the p/e&#39;s were about 30. during 1982 stocks sold at only a p/e of 8
- p/e go up with lower interest rates and go down with higher interest rates because now equities have to compete with bonds

stocks for the long run

- real stock returns in the 19th century do not differ appreciably from the real returns in the 20th century
- stocks fluctuate both below and above the trendline but eventually return to the trend. aka mean reversion. this means that periods of above average returns tend to be followed by periods of below average returns and vice versa
- in the short run, stock returns are very volatile driven by changes in earnings, interest rates, risk, uncertainty and psychological factors
- the stock market has real annualized returns of 6.7% from 1802-1870, 6.6% from 1871-1925, and 6.4% from 1926-2012. this is remarkable constancy
- as stable as the long-term returns for equities have been, the same cannot be said of fixed-income investments. real returns on treasures were 5.1% in the early 19th century to a bare 0.6% since 1926, only slightly above inflation
- real return on bonds have shown a similar but more moderate decline as fixed-income. 4.8% in the first period to 3.7% in the 2nd period and now only 2.6% in the current period.
- the excess return of stocks over bonds is referred to as the equity risk premium.
- subtracting stock and bond returns from equity shows that the premium has averaged 3% against bonds and 3.9% over treasury bills over the last 200 years.
- 19 countries were analyzed from 1900-2012 and it was determined that the us experience of equites outperforming bonds and bills has been mirrored in all countries examined. every country achieved equity performance that was better than bonds.
- while the us and uk have performed well, that is no indication that they are out of line with other countries. therefore, studies on the us market results have relevance to all investors in all countries
- swings in investor sentiment from political or economic crisis can throw stocks off their long-term path, but the fundamental forces producing economic growth have always enabled equities to regain their long-term trend
- correlations between asset classes can and do change over time
- during 20 year holding periods, stock have never fallen below inflation. bond and treasury bills have lagged by as much as 3% below inflation
- the worst 30-year timeframe since 1802 stocks beat inflation by 2.6%.
- as the holding period increases, the odds that stocks will beat bonds or bills increase drastically
- on any given 2-year cycle, there is a 33% chance bonds or bills will beat stocks
- under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&#39;s. under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds
- because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again
- real returns (post tax) since 1913 (income tax enacted) have ranged from 6.1%-2.7% on stocks, 2.2% to -0.3% for bonds and bills having a 0.4% to -2.3%
- taxes have the greatest impact on fixed income investments
- since 1871, for someone in the highest tax bracket, short term treasury bills have had a negative real return after tax
- the inflation tax hits harder when the holding period is shorter. the more you buy and sell, the more frequently the government can tax the gains, which might not be real after inflation
- p/e ratio is the ratio of a stock&#39;s price to its earnings. the average p/e is 15 from 1871-2012
- earnings yield is important also. it measures the earnings generated per dollar of stock market value. ie – if the p/e of the market is 15 means the earnings yield is 1/15 or 6.67% which is historically accurate long-term rate of return on stocks. this is not a coincidence. if the p/e went to 20 it would be 1/20 or 5%.
- but there have been changes in the economy and markets that may rise the average p/e in the future. these changes include a decrease in the cost of investing in indexes, a lower discount rate, and an increase in knowledge about the advantages of equity vs fixed income investing.
- there are many reasons for a decline in real returns available to investors. whatever the reasons, such a decline implies that the real return on equity need not be as high as it had historically been to attract investors. the historic equity risk premium was 3-3.5%. if we assume the long-run real rate is somewhere around 2%, then a 3% equity premium will require a 5% real return on stocks, which, gives us an average p/e of 20. 1/20 = 5%
- transaction costs have come down and this has led to a higher p/e ratio than in the past
- the equity risk premium also itself may have shrunk. there is considerable truth in the statement that widespread knowledge of the profitability of common stocks, gained from the studies that have been made, tends to diminish the likelihood that correspondingly large profits can be gained from stocks in the future. the competitive bidding for stocks causes prices at the time of purchase to be high
- investors are drawn to firms able to generate high earnings and revenue growth. but empirical data shows this pursuit of growth often leads to subpar returns. ie – ibm vs exxon 1950-2012. exxon was a better investment
- financial theory has shown that if capital markets are &quot;efficient&quot; in the sense that known valuation criteria, such as earnings, dividends, cash flows, book values, and other factors are already factored into the security price, investing on the basis of these fundamentals will not improve returns.
- in an efficient market, the only way investors can consistently earn higher returns is to undertake higher risk, where risk is defined as the correlation of an asset&#39;s return with the overall stock market. this was the basis for the capital asset pricing model (capm) or beta
- beta and capm was the primary basis for stock returns in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s. unfortunately, beta and capm did not prove effective in explaining the differences in returns among individual stocks
- don&#39;t use beta to try to buy stocks, it doesn&#39;t work
- fama and french wrote an article that showed there are 2 factors (size and value) that are far more important in determining a stock return that the beta of a stock
- although the historical return on small stocks has outpaced large stocks since 1926, the magnitude of small cap outperformance has waxed and waned unpredictably.
- the existence of a small-cap premium does not mean they will outperform large stock every year or even every decade. they have lost to large cap for more than a decade before.
- f+f also determined that value played a role in returns. stocks with low prices relative to their fundamentals are value stocks. stocks with high prices relative to their fundamentals are growth stocks
- in 1978 ramaswamy and litzenberger established a significant correlation between dividend yield and subsequent return. o&#39;shaughnessy has shown that in the period of 1951-1994, the 50 highest dividend yielding large cap stocks had a return that was 1.7% higher than the market
- basu did some studies in the 1960&#39;s that showed that stocks with lower p/e ratios have significantly higher returns than stocks with high p/e ratios, even after accounting for risks
- graham wrote in security analysis (1940) that people who habitually pay more than 16x average earnings are likely to lose considerable money in the long run
- p/b ratio is a good ratio but there are conceptual problems with using book value as a value criterion. it does not correct for changes in the market value of assets, not does it capitalize r+d expenditures. from 1987-2012 the author determined that book value underperformed either dividend yields or p/e ratios in explaining returns
- the worst course an investor can take is to follow the prevailing sentiment about economic activity. that will lead investors to buy at high prices when times are good and everyone is optimistic and sell at the low
- since 1885, there have been 145 days where the market moved 5% or more. only ¼ of those days can be attributed to an event. this confirms the unpredictability of the market and the difficulty in forecasting moves
- news moves markets. but the timing of much news is unpredictable, like wars, political developments, and natural disasters
- markets do not",,,
directly respond to what is announced, rather, they respond to the difference between what the traders expect to happen and what actually happens. the market already incorporates all the information that was expected,,,,,,,
- for example – a strong economic report can send stocks down. why? because even though the news is good for main street and corporate earnings, it can mean the federal reserve will raise interest rates, which raises the discount rate at which these future profits are discounted,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
- although fascinating to observe and understand a market&#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (cpi, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.,,,,,,
- from 1971-2012, the average u.s. equity active mutual fund returned 1% below the wilshire 5000 index and 0.88% below the s&amp;p 500 index.,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, investment managers are not beating the market; the market is beating them,,,,,,,,
- investing $1000 with a compound return of 11% will accumulate 23,000 in 30 years. a 1% fee will reduce this number by 1/3. a 3% fee will reduce it to just over 10,000. the fees add up.,,,,,,,
- in the 1990&#39;s passive investing took off. indexing has low fees. most investors are better off in a capitalization weighted index fund,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, the price usually goes up forcing the index to have to pay inflated prices,,,,,,,,

#NAME?, the market is beating them,,,,,,,,
  - over 1 year, 70% of professionals underperform their benchmarks,,,,,,,,
  - over 10 years,80%,,,,,,,,
  - over 15 years,90%,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, some professional money managers will beat the market in any given year. but most will not over the long term and there is no reliable way to figure out who would be in that 10% that outperforms ahead of time,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
  - 10% in the 1960&#39;s to over 90% currently.,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, &quot;it will fluctuate.&quot;,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, somehow expecting more of the same to continue,,,,,,,,
  - math example – if dividends are at 1.5% and corporate earnings are growing at 4.5% (historical average), then a composite of 6% return is reasonable. this is the fundamental rate of return the investor can expect from the market,,,,,,,,
  - then you add or subtract the changes in p/e over that time frame. the average p/e in recent decades has been about 15.5. this is the speculative return component,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, but predicting it accurately is impossible,,,,,,,,
  - predicting where the market will be in the long run is not hard, but even estimating how it will move in the next few months is impossible and pointless,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
one up on wall street,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, you should too. management normally sells 2.3 shares for every 1 share they buy. in 1987 after the crash, it was 4 buys for 1 sell,,,,,,,
#NAME?, any stock being touted as the next x,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
- p/e ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. ie = p/e of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
- p/e ratio that is half the growth rate (annual earnings) is very positive and one that is twice the growth rate is very negative. ie = p/e of 10 should be growing at 10%,,,,,,,,,
- formula = growth rate plus dividend yield divided by p/e. ie = 12% growth + 3% yield/10 p/e = 1.5. less than 1 is bad. 1.5 is ok and 2+ is great.,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, which is a good indicator of weather the market at large is over or under valued. if some stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to earnings, then it could be likely most stocks are selling at inflated prices.,,,,,,,

**The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing**

- Buffet – Newtons 4th law of motion. Investor return decrease as motion increases.
- Winning Strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever
- The index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. Only stock market risk remains, which is large
- A traditional index fund operates with minimal expenses, no advisory fees, with tiny portfolio turnover, and high tax efficiency.
- Investing in equities long term is a winner&#39;s game
- The returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market
- Investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.
- Mutual fund investors are confident they can easily select the right fund managers. They are WRONG
- When the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with…. Over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company
- The stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. But this goes up and down in cycles. As investors are willing to pay higher or lower P/E.
- Investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. About 9.5% for the last 100 years
- Reversions to the mean – Tendency for P/E ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.
- Economics controls the long-term stock market return. Emotions control the short term. Accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible
- Occam&#39;s razor – when there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the most simple
- Solution – buy and hold a diversified, low cost portfolio that tracks the stock market
- Investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, BEFORE THE COSTS OF INVESTING ARE DEDUCTED – when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees – the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. The lower these costs the better
- Before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game, after costs, it is a loser&#39;s game
- Focus on the lowest cost funds – the more managers take, the less investors make
- Don&#39;t invest in funds based on past performance. Performance comes and goes. But costs go on forever
- Costs
  - Expense Ratio
  - Sales Charge
  - Purchase and sale of securities or turnover
  - Assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. IE - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%
- Low cost funds beat high cost funds
- Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.
- Actively managed funds are tax inefficient due to turnover
- Fund returns are devastated by costs, adverse fund section, bad timing, taxes and inflation
- Don&#39;t look for the needle, just buy the whole haystack
- 355 equity funds from 1970 to 2006 – 80% had gone out of business. Only 2 of the 355 funds had superior performance during this time (beat the index by 2%) 8 funds beat the index by 1%. The odds of you picking one of these funds is extremely low.
- As the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.
- Picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty
- Over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?
  - Bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years
  - They reduce volatility in the portfolio
- Investors who seek to increase yields in their bonds by investing in junk bonds should be careful. If you are going to do it make it a very small percent of your portfolio.
- Long term bonds are much more volatile than short term
- Ben Graham – The average manager cannot obtain better results than the S+P 500. Investors should be content with earning the markets return. Only low-cost index investing can guarantee that outcome.
- Asset allocation accounts for 94% of return. 2 factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio
  - Ability to take risk – depends on financial position, liabilities, years. In general, you are able to take more risks the longer time horizon you have
  - Willingness to take risk – matter of preference. Some investors can handle the up and downs. If you can&#39;t sleep at night, you have too much risk.
  - These two factors determine your risk tolerance
- Rebalance portfolios at most once per year

**The Bogleheads Guide to Investing**

- Have a 3 month to 1-year emergency fund available. Most people 6 months is good
- How much you save is the primary driver of wealth accumulation
- Buying a new car every few years can decrease your net worth more than anything
- Stock – you are an owner in the business
- Bond – you are a creditor
- Make sure you put your least tax efficient funds in a tax-sheltered account and your more efficient funds in a taxable account. Stocks are more tax efficient than bonds.

- Order from least to most tax efficient
  - High-Yield Bonds – least tax efficient
  - International Bonds
  - Taxable Domestic Bonds
  - TIPS
  - REITs
  - Balanced Funds
  - Active Stock funds
  - Stock trading accounts
  - Small cap stocks
  - Large value stocks
  - International Stocks
  - Large growth stocks
  - Stock index funds
  - Tax managed funds
  - EE and I bonds
  - Money Market funds
  - Municipal bonds – most tax efficient
- Don&#39;t try to time the market. You can&#39;t do it. No one knows where it will be next year.
- A large study was done on financial newsletters, &quot;experts&quot;, and TV shows and it was determined there is no evidence that they can time the market and consistent with mutual fund studies, winners rarely win again and losers often lose again.
- Picking mutual funds based on Morningstar&#39;s rating system doesn&#39;t work. 5-star portfolios have underperformed the S+P 500
- Rebalancing works on the theory of RTM (reversion to the mean) so you are essentially selling high and buying low.
- You can rebalance by selling your winners, putting new money into the underweight funds, or instead of reinvesting dividends, direct them toward the underweight funds. Think about the tax consequences of this if the funds are in a taxable account
- It is not a good idea to not rebalance and let your winner&#39;s ride. If you had done this in the late 90&#39;s, tech would have been massively overweighed in your portfolio and you would have taken a huge hit. But if you rebalanced, you locked in some of those gains.
- Tune out the &quot;noise&quot;
- No one knows what the market will do short term
- Mutual fund reporters lead a secret life. By day they write &quot;Six funds to buy NOW!!!!.... By night, they invest in index funds",160,0.97,61,Bogleheads,6/30/21 23:08,"**john bogle**

- when the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with…. over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company
- the stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. but this goes up and down in cycles. as investors are willing to pay higher or lower p/e.
- investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. about 9.5% for the last 100 years
- reversions to the mean – tendency for p/e ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.
- economics controls the long-term stock market return. emotions control the short term. accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible
- occam&#39;s razor – when there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the most simple
- solution – buy and hold a diversified, low cost portfolio that tracks the stock market
- investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, before the costs of investing are deducted – when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees – the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. the lower these costs the better
- before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game, after costs, it is a loser&#39;s game
- focus on the lowest cost funds – the more managers take, the less investors make
- don&#39;t invest in funds based on past performance. performance comes and goes. but costs go on forever
- costs
  - expense ratio
  - sales charge
  - purchase and sale of securities or turnover
  - assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. ie - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%
- low cost funds beat high cost funds
- most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. investors chase past performance.
- actively managed funds are tax inefficient due to turnover
- fund returns are devastated by costs, adverse fund section, bad timing, taxes and inflation
- don&#39;t look for the needle, just buy the whole haystack
- 355 equity funds from 1970 to 2006 – 80% had gone out of business. only 2 of the 355 funds had superior performance during this time (beat the index by 2%) 8 funds beat the index by 1%. the odds of you picking one of these funds is extremely low.
- as the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.
- picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty
- over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?
  - bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years
  - they reduce volatility in the portfolio
- investors who seek to increase yields in their bonds by investing in junk bonds should be careful. if you are going to do it make it a very small percent of your portfolio.
- long term bonds are much more volatile than short term
- ben graham – the average manager cannot obtain better results than the s+p 500. investors should be content with earning the markets return. only low-cost index investing can guarantee that outcome.
- asset allocation accounts for 94% of return. 2 factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio
  - ability to take risk – depends on financial position, liabilities, years. in general, you are able to take more risks the longer time horizon you have
  - willingness to take risk – matter of preference. some investors can handle the up and downs. if you can&#39;t sleep at night, you have too much risk.
  - these two factors determine your risk tolerance
- rebalance portfolios at most once per year

**the bogleheads guide to investing**

- have a 3 month to 1-year emergency fund available. most people 6 months is good
- how much you save is the primary driver of wealth accumulation
- buying a new car every few years can decrease your net worth more than anything
- stock – you are an owner in the business
- bond – you are a creditor
- make sure you put your least tax efficient funds in a tax-sheltered account and your more efficient funds in a taxable account. stocks are more tax efficient than bonds.

- order from least to most tax efficient
  - high-yield bonds – least tax efficient
  - international bonds
  - taxable domestic bonds
  - tips
  - reits
  - balanced funds
  - active stock funds
  - stock trading accounts
  - small cap stocks
  - large value stocks
  - international stocks
  - large growth stocks
  - stock index funds
  - tax managed funds
  - ee and i bonds
  - money market funds
  - municipal bonds – most tax efficient
- don&#39;t try to time the market. you can&#39;t do it. no one knows where it will be next year.
- a large study was done on financial newsletters, &quot;experts&quot;, and tv shows and it was determined there is no evidence that they can time the market and consistent with mutual fund studies, winners rarely win again and losers often lose again.
- picking mutual funds based on morningstar&#39;s rating system doesn&#39;t work. 5-star portfolios have underperformed the s+p 500
- rebalancing works on the theory of rtm (reversion to the mean) so you are essentially selling high and buying low.
- you can rebalance by selling your winners, putting new money into the underweight funds, or instead of reinvesting dividends, direct them toward the underweight funds. think about the tax consequences of this if the funds are in a taxable account
- it is not a good idea to not rebalance and let your winner&#39;s ride. if you had done this in the late 90&#39;s, tech would have been massively overweighed in your portfolio and you would have taken a huge hit. but if you rebalanced, you locked in some of those gains.
- tune out the &quot;noise&quot;
- no one knows what the market will do short term
- mutual fund reporters lead a secret life. by day they write &quot;six funds to buy now!!!!.... by night, they invest in index funds"

**All About Asset Allocation and Protecting Your Wealth**

-	As a nation, we are not saving enough in retirement accounts to make up for diminishing Social Security benefits and other traditional sources of income
-	10% savings of pre-tax income is a good target for most people
-	Investors tend to suffer from overconfidence
-	You can&#39;t time the market. If Nobel winners have tried and failed (Long-Term Capital Management), what chance do I have? And during a bear market, stocks usually decline much faster than they advance during a bull market. But you don&#39;t want to get out of the market then because you will miss the rally.
-	A good idea is to decide on a static percentage of stocks, bonds, alternative investments that fit your needs and then maintain that allocation for a long, long, long time. Then rebalance as needed.
-	We also have a fondness for seeing patterns where they don&#39;t exist. Stocks that have done well in the past are expected to continue to do well and stocks that have done poorly are expected to continue to do poorly
-	Avoid the temptation to follow the herd and invest in the hottest sectors or stocks.
-	Don&#39;t chase popular investment styles. Stick with your plan and give it time to work out
-	It is impossible to predict which type of fund will outperform any given year. Therefore, the best strategy is to hold a diversified portfolio that contains all types and stick with it
-	The more a mutual fund charges in fees, the lower the expected return
-	Take caution where you get financial advice, most of it is just salesmanship
-	Schools have spent lots of money and hours trying to figure out which active managed mutual fund managers are likely to outperform in the future. They discovered 2 facts
  - Funds with low fees tend to outperform the market
  - It is unreliable to assume that managers who have beaten the market in the past will continue to do so over the long term
-	On any given year, the index fund will be beat by many active managed funds. But in the long run, the index fund will be at the top
-	Reduce your estimated SS check at retirement by 60-70% and an increase of 5-7 years for retirement
-	Treat SS and defined pension plans as a separate account and don&#39;t use it in your equity/bond calculations
-	On the short term, it is nearly impossible to predict the movement of the stock market. But over the long term, the performance of the stock market is predictable because it follows the growth of the U.S. economy
-	Earnings Growth (Corporate Earnings or GDP) +Dividend (Yield)+Speculation (P/E ratio) = market return
-	In the short run, speculation creates the volatility in stock prices, but in the long term, economic growth is the real driver of returns. You can&#39;t guess what P/E ratio the market will assign in the future so don&#39;t try
-	It is impossible to forecast the movement of the inflation rate, but you can limit risk by purchasing short term bonds. They don&#39;t have the volatility of long-term bonds. You do get extra yield from long term bonds but it does not justify the added interest rate risk
-	Diversify your portfolio across investments in several asset classes to reduce risk and increase return
-	Make sure your investments have a low correlation with each other or you don&#39;t get the benefits of diversification
-	Rebalance your portfolio at least 1 per year
-	Key points of book – All About Asset Allocation
  - Allocate our investments across multiple asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk
  - Invest broadly within each class to eliminate the risk of owning any single security
  - Keep your costs down including taxes
  - Rebalance periodically
-	Rebalancing is the most difficult because it forces you to sell what is going up and to buy what went down
-	Try to rebalance through changes in what you buy, try not to rebalance by selling assets
-	Use a long-term strategic asset allocation or &quot;buy and hold&quot;. No predictions needed.
-	A successful lifelong investment experience hinges on 3 critical steps
  - Development of a prudent financial plan
  - The full implementation of that plan
  - The discipline to maintain that plan in good AND bad times
-	Investment Pyramid – 5 levels
  - Base 1 – Cash accounts for living expenses
    - Checking
    - Savings
    - Money Market
    - Emergency Fund
  - 2 - Discretionary long-term liquid investments
    - Mutual Funds
    - ETF
    - Bonds
    - CD&#39;s
    - Annuities
  - 3 – Discretionary long term illiquid assets
    - Personal Home
    - Properties
    - Business
    - Collectibles
  - 4 – Nondiscretionary assets
    - Social Security
    - Pension
  - Top 5 – Discretionary Speculative
    - Commodities
    - Individual Stocks
-	6-12-month Emergency Fund recommended
-	Investing in the next hot item is very difficult to do
-	Picking a manager who can pick the next hot item is equally difficult to do
-	Do not select mutual funds on past performance. Past performance is not an indication of future results
-	Investment returns are directly related to investment risk
-	There are no risk-free investments
-	Practitioners view risk as investment volatility
-	Individuals view risk as losing money
-	There is a direct relationship between risk taken and amount of expected return
-	Investments with less risk of income disruptions have lower expected returns
-	Portfolio risk cannot be eliminated but it can be controlled with an asset allocation strategy
-	T-Bills are &quot;risk free&quot; but can still lose money due to taxes and inflation. If their purchasing power doesn&#39;t keep up
-	High volatility means erratic returns. Low volatility means more consistent returns
-	Rebalancing is based on a theory called regression to the mean. That is, there is a natural tendency in the marketplace for all broad asset classes to return close to their history risk profiles.
-	When you rebalance, you sell some of the winners to buy some of the losers. It may feel counterintuitive at first but it follows the logic to buy low and sell high
-	Calendar based rebalancing is a good idea. Pick a date and rebalance then. You are more likely to not procrastinate
-	Rebalancing only works if the investments in the portfolio don&#39;t act the same way. You want assets that don&#39;t correlate with each other
-	If 2 investments move in the same direction at the same time, they have positive correlation. If they move in opposite directions, they have negative correlation.
-	You want investments that have lower correlation to each other
-	Don&#39;t purchase new investments that have a high positive correlation with investments you already have
-	Negative correlation is theoretically ideal when selecting investments but this doesn&#39;t occur in the real world. Typically, the best asset pairs you will find are noncorrelated
  - Correlation is measured on a -1 to +1 scale
    - +0.3 or greater is positive
    - -0.3 or less is negative
    - -0.3 to 0.3 is noncorrelated
-	Correlations are dynamic, not static. And you can&#39;t guess when/how they will change. For example – The S+P 500 and Intermediate term treasury bonds have been between +0.49 to -0.42 correlated in the last 20 years (1990-2009). Average was 0 so they are noncorrelated
-	Correlation is not the only reason to invest. The security must also have a positive expected rate of return. It is basically impossible to find 2 negative correlated asset classes that both earn a positive rate of return. Noncorrelated is your best bet
-	You cannot eliminate all risk from a portfolio but you can reduce it
-	You will lose money during some times. Don&#39;t try to market time your way out of it. You can&#39;t
-	Do NOT abandon your plan because you lose money. In the last 50 years the market is up 4 years for every 1 down
-	Owning several asset classes is better than owning a few
-	Choose asset classes that have positive real returns and lower correlation
-	You can select a good asset allocation but not a perfect one. Don&#39;t overanalyze
-	It is not possible to know which asset classes will perform well at any given time, therefore it is important to retain ALL asset classes in your portfolio at all times and to rebalance these annually.
-	The perfect portfolio can only be known in retrospect. So, don&#39;t overanalyze
-	Foreign stocks are great for US investors
  - They do not always move in correlation with the US market
  - They trade in foreign currency which is another diversifier
-	During extreme volatility when you want low correlation among asset classes, positive correlation increases drastically across all classes. Especially during bear markets or disasters
-	There is no known way to design a portfolio that is fully hedged against downturns while fully participating in the upswings
-	Look for mutual funds that have low expense ratios and no redemption fees
-	Prefer index mutual funds and ETF&#39;s
-	Stay away from high cost illiquid investments unless you really know what you are doing
-	You have to stay invested during all market conditions to benefit from the gains

Equities

-	An investment in a total US stock market fund is a solid foundation on which to base a US stock market allocation. Total Index are heavily weighted toward large cap stocks
-	Take your age x 1.5 for your % AA to a TDF. Example. 40 x 1.5 = 60% allocation to TDF
-	Midcap indexes are highly correlated with total stock market indexes and are therefore a poor diversifier. You don&#39;t need them
-	25% max dedicated toward factor tilts
-	If you want to tilt, above all, be patient and stick to your guns. Don&#39;t chase returns. Once you decide to tilt, you need to stick with that strategy and not bailout of it
-	The enemy of a good asset allocation is the quest for a perfect one. Fight the urge to be perfect
-	Study in 1992 By Fama and French – Performance of a broadly diversified US stock portfolio relied on 3 primary risks axis to determine its return. 95% accuracy as to what the portfolio would return
  - Market risk or Beta – all portfolios move up or down in relation to the total stock market
  - Percent of small cap in the portfolio by weight – small stocks have higher returns and do not always have correlation to the total stock market
  - Percent of value orientation – value stocks have a higher return than growth and do not correlate with growth stocks
-	Small cap value index has outperformed growth with less standard deviation from 1979-2009
  - Having a 50/50 value/growth index during this time added no return and increased standard deviation
-	Small cap stocks have higher expected returns but also higher standard deviation than large cap
  - This occurs in foreign markets too
-	Small Cap value along with total stock market is a good choice in your portfolio

International

-	International equity provides currency diversification
-	Global equity invests in both US and international. Not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money want diversification from 1 fund
-	Good idea to have both US AND International equities in your portfolio at all times. You don&#39;t know which one will win. US won from 1970-2001 then International has won since
-	Canada&#39;s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials. Canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices
-	A permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended. Emerging markets are very volatile. Recently Emerging markets have increased their correlation to US markets but this may or may not continue
-	Generally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio
-	Independent studies prove the size and value premium (F+F study above) works in international stocks like it does with US. This means international small cap is a good idea too
-	Foreign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk. You must understand these risks. But they do provide diversification to a portfolio

Fixed Income

-	A diversified fixed income portfolio enhances return
-	Low-cost bond mutual funds are an ideal way to invest
-	Tax considerations may be an important element in fixed income when investing in a taxable account
-	Bond Structure
  - Short – 3 years or less
  - Intermediate – 4 to 9 years
  - Long – 10+ years
-	Longer term bonds have higher interest rate risk. Longer maturity = higher rates. Opposite true
-	Lower quality bonds have higher credit risk. Lower credit rating = higher rates. Opposite true
-	High yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default
-	Municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts

REIT

-	Real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds
-	REIT are a convenient way to invest in real estate
-	REITs have low correlation with stocks and bonds
-	Nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge. Therefore, REITs are a good inflation hedge
-	REITs are the simplest way to participate in the real estate market. They are also liquid
-	Index Equity REITs and ETFs are a good choice
-	REITs are divided into 3 categories
  - Equity – Real estate properties. Most pure holding
  - Mortgage REITs – do not own property, they finance property. Bond investment
  - Hybrid – Hold both
-	10% allocation to REIT is enough
-	Do not include home equity in your asset allocation models
-	Equity REITs are portfolios of apartments, hotels, malls, industrial buildings, and other rental property

Behavioral

-	Realistic expectations are important to investment planning
-	Market volatility is more predictable than market return
-	Investments with expected positive investment return and higher volatility have higher expected return
-	All investments have risk. Even T-Bills which is inflation risk. There is no risk-free investment
-	No more than 12 funds because it gets too complex with higher fees and diminishing returns
-	Do not change your percentage of equity/bond based on what you think the market will do. Once you select a ratio stick with it.
-	Most people can&#39;t stomach a 100% equity portfolio
-	A well-developed plan works only when the investor sticks to the plan through good and bad times
-	A sensible investment plan never fails an investor, the investor fails the plan
-	People tend to more optimistic about stocks after the market goes up and less after it goes down
-	Investors give too much weight to recent information
-	People tend to buy investments that have had a recent run-up in performance
-	Investors label investments good or bad depending of the price relative to where they bought it
-	People are reluctant to admit errors
-	Overconfident investors generally believe they have more knowledge and information than they actually do. Therefore, they tend to trade too much and underperform
-	Males tend to be overconfident
-	Females tend to do better at sticking to a long-term plan and usually perform better
-	Do not change your investment strategy during a bear market
-	If you can rebalance without hesitation even during bad markets, your risk tolerance is good
-	Many portfolio failures occur when investors take on too much risk

When to change your asset allocation

-	3 Reasons to change your AA
  - Financial goal is well within reach
  - You realize you will not need all your money during your lifetime
  - You risk tolerance isn&#39;t what you thought it was
-	Any AA changes should require deep thinking and even-handed judgement. Don&#39;t make changes during times of duress

Where to put your money

-	Tax Deferred
  - Corportate bonds
  - CD
  - High turnover mutual funds
  - REITs
  - Commodities Funds
-	Taxable
  - Low turnover equity funds
  - ETFs
  - Municipal bonds",152,0.93,54,Bogleheads,1/19/23 21:08,"**richard ferri**

-	global equity invests in both us and international. not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money want diversification from 1 fund
-	good idea to have both us and international equities in your portfolio at all times. you don&#39;t know which one will win. us won from 1970-2001 then international has won since
-	canada&#39;s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials. canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices
-	a permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended. emerging markets are very volatile. recently emerging markets have increased their correlation to us markets but this may or may not continue
-	generally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio
-	independent studies prove the size and value premium (f+f study above) works in international stocks like it does with us. this means international small cap is a good idea too
-	foreign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk. you must understand these risks. but they do provide diversification to a portfolio

fixed income

-	a diversified fixed income portfolio enhances return
-	low-cost bond mutual funds are an ideal way to invest
-	tax considerations may be an important element in fixed income when investing in a taxable account
-	bond structure
  - short – 3 years or less
  - intermediate – 4 to 9 years
  - long – 10+ years
-	longer term bonds have higher interest rate risk. longer maturity = higher rates. opposite true
-	lower quality bonds have higher credit risk. lower credit rating = higher rates. opposite true
-	high yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default
-	municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts

reit

-	real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds
-	reit are a convenient way to invest in real estate
-	reits have low correlation with stocks and bonds
-	nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge. therefore, reits are a good inflation hedge
-	reits are the simplest way to participate in the real estate market. they are also liquid
-	index equity reits and etfs are a good choice
-	reits are divided into 3 categories
  - equity – real estate properties. most pure holding
  - mortgage reits – do not own property, they finance property. bond investment
  - hybrid – hold both
-	10% allocation to reit is enough
-	do not include home equity in your asset allocation models
-	equity reits are portfolios of apartments, hotels, malls, industrial buildings, and other rental property

behavioral

-	realistic expectations are important to investment planning
-	market volatility is more predictable than market return
-	investments with expected positive investment return and higher volatility have higher expected return
-	all investments have risk. even t-bills which is inflation risk. there is no risk-free investment
-	no more than 12 funds because it gets too complex with higher fees and diminishing returns
-	do not change your percentage of equity/bond based on what you think the market will do. once you select a ratio stick with it.
-	most people can&#39;t stomach a 100% equity portfolio
-	a well-developed plan works only when the investor sticks to the plan through good and bad times
-	a sensible investment plan never fails an investor, the investor fails the plan
-	people tend to more optimistic about stocks after the market goes up and less after it goes down
-	investors give too much weight to recent information
-	people tend to buy investments that have had a recent run-up in performance
-	investors label investments good or bad depending of the price relative to where they bought it
-	people are reluctant to admit errors
-	overconfident investors generally believe they have more knowledge and information than they actually do. therefore, they tend to trade too much and underperform
-	males tend to be overconfident
-	females tend to do better at sticking to a long-term plan and usually perform better
-	do not change your investment strategy during a bear market
-	if you can rebalance without hesitation even during bad markets, your risk tolerance is good
-	many portfolio failures occur when investors take on too much risk

when to change your asset allocation

-	3 reasons to change your aa
  - financial goal is well within reach
  - you realize you will not need all your money during your lifetime
  - you risk tolerance isn&#39;t what you thought it was
-	any aa changes should require deep thinking and even-handed judgement. don&#39;t make changes during times of duress

where to put your money

-	tax deferred
  - corportate bonds
  - cd
  - high turnover mutual funds
  - reits
  - commodities funds
-	taxable
  - low turnover equity funds
  - etfs
  - municipal bonds"

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

- Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &quot;QE&quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
- The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
- **Template of a debt crisis**
- Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
- Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
- During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
- Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
- Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
- Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
- Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
- Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
- It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
- No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
- During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &quot;bailing out&quot; financial institutions
- Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
- It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
- By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
- Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

- Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &quot;Goldilocks&quot; period
- Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
- The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &quot;wealth effect&quot; occurs when one&#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &quot;cheap&quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
- The &quot;Depression&quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &quot;QE&quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &quot;real&quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &quot;QE&quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
- The &quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&#39;s and cause a &quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&#39;t happen without a revolution
- Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &quot;QE&quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
- Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

- Reserve currency countries that don&#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
- If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one

# **Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle**

- Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression
- Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if
  - Don&#39;t have reserve currency
  - Have low foreign exchange reserves
  - Have large foreign debt
  - Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit
  - Have negative real interest rates
  - History of high inflation
- 5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage
  - Early – Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
  - Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &quot;hot&quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
  - Top – Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
    - Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
    - Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
      - Spending down reserves
      - Raising rates
    - Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
  - Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
    - Usually, 30% decline in the currency
    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
  - Normalization – Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

# **Hyperinflation**

- If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
- Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop
- People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value
- How to invest during a hyperinflation episode – Short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (Gold), and invest in commodity industries (Gold, Oil, etc)",149,0.95,48,Bogleheads,6/30/21 22:59,"# **ray dalio**

  - early – low debt levels. productive investments. attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
  - bubble – good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. but debts are rising faster than incomes. asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. country becomes the &quot;hot&quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
  - top – bubble bursts. the inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
    - central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
    - central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
      - spending down reserves
      - raising rates
    - last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
  - depression – policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. a gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&#39;t good. most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&#39;t. after policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
    - usually, 30% decline in the currency
    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
  - normalization – supply demand balance return. typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). but the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

# **hyperinflation**

- if countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. and this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
- inflation psychology sets in with the public. currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop
- people totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value
- how to invest during a hyperinflation episode – short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (gold), and invest in commodity industries (gold, oil, etc)"

-	Beta is a measure of a stock or market volatility in relation to the overall market. 1 = standard market risk. 2 = 2x the market risk, IE your portfolio will move 2x the market. Beta = volatility
-	Alpha – The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index is the investment&#39;s alpha
  - 20% of active managers got positive alpha in the 90&#39;s. That number is down to 2%
  - Why – The market has become more efficient. It is harder to exploit. What were sources of &quot;alpha&quot; are gone, dramatically reducing the ability to generate alpha. The remaining competition is going to get better and better because the men and women left standing are more skillful than the people who were playing before.&quot; 90% of trading is done by institutional investors that know what they are doing. And more money is chasing that shrinking pool of alpha that is available.
  - Taking more risks in your portfolio (IE – Leverage) doesn&#39;t increase your alpha.
-	Active management is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there must be a loser. And usually that loser is an individual investor. And more people are going toward passive management so there are less &quot;fish&quot; at the table to exploit
-	You cannot rely on active managers to get you excess returns. You have a 1/50 chance of picking the right person.
  - This evidence shows this is true in all asset classes. Small, Large, Value, Foreign, Bonds, etc.
-	You can&#39;t forecast where the market is going. Don&#39;t try to time the market.
  - Focus on what you can control. Costs, Diversify, and Tax efficiency
-	Do not buy a home as an investment. It is place to live.
-	Once the information is readily available, prices already reflect this and it is too late to act
-	Don&#39;t buy individual stocks
-	Do not buy ETN (Exchanged Traded Note) you are taking on credit risk which you are not compensated for. ETN investors with Lehman Brothers lost 85% when the company failed
-	Overvaluation of stocks tend to persist longer than undervaluation. Why? More difficult and risky for the investor to short a stock
-	Sinclair - &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it&quot;
-	Markets are highly efficient in the sense that available information is rapidly digested and reflected in stock prices
-	What was once alpha, now becomes beta as different factors are discovered. IE – Benjamin Graham invested in &quot;value&quot; stocks. But when value was discovered as a factor, its alpha disappeared
-	Warren Buffets success can be attributed to his use of factors and not his stock picking ability
-	&quot;Wisdom of the crowds&quot; makes the market a very difficult competitor

-	Investors tend to buy AFTER periods of good performance and sell AFTER periods of poor performance
-	The best measure we have of estimating future returns is the Shiller CAPE ratio. Higher CAPE ratio = lower expected future returns. Average ratio is 16.5 with an average return of 6.8%
  - 10 year estimated return per year

-	3 new factors discovered to consider
  - Momentum – stocks with positive momentum outperform those with negative
  - Profitability – more profitable companies outperform
  - Quality – High quality outperform low
-	Gold
  - Gold is an inflation hedge but only over very long periods (100+ years). Gold doesn&#39;t protect against inflation over 10-year periods. Example of long horizon - Roman centurions made the same in gold as Army Captains today. The price of bread in Rome is the same as today in gold.
  - Gold is not a good hedge of currency risk
  - Safe Haven asset &quot;stable during bear market&quot; – It had an 83% success rate when stocks produced a negative return
-	Don&#39;t include your home in your financial AA decisions
-	Don&#39;t think about your risk assets in isolation. Think entire portfolio
-	Charles Ellis called active stock management a &quot;loser&#39;s game&quot;. The best way to win is to not play
-	If it is possible to own a &quot;core&quot; fund, that is a better choice. IE – use the Vanguard Total International Fund to get your Emerging market allocation if possible, rather than buying the Emerging market fund separate. Min turnover and transaction costs

**Reducing the Risks of Black Swans**

-	Current stock market valuations play a very important role in determining future returns
-	Shiller CAPE 10 ratio is a good ratio to think about future returns.
-	Higher ratio = lower future returns. Lower ratio = higher future returns. But there is a wide dispersion of potential outcomes
-	Your labor capital should play a role in your risk in your portfolio. More stable job = more risks in the portfolio. Less stable job = less risks in the portfolio
-	Tilting the portfolio adds the important consideration of tracking error regret. Tracking error is the amount by which a portfolios performance varies from that of the total market.
-	You basically have a little bit of super risky assets and a lot of very conservative assets. Nothing in the middle. This lowers the tail risk of the portfolio both to the positive and negative (lowers standard deviation of the portfolio).
-	Example is instead of a 60/40 Total Market/Bond portfolio, you have a 40/60 Small Cap Value/Bond portfolio",143,0.93,21,Bogleheads,12/18/22 10:17,"**the incredible shrinking alpha**

sx3vtd,captmorgan50,Inflation,"Seeing lots of posts about inflation recently.  Thought it might be a good idea to review it and some options you have to defend against it.  And I will put my personal positions at the bottom.

From Deep Risk by Bernstein

**Deep Risk – Young investors series**

-	2 types of Risk
  - Shallow Risk – loss of real capital that recovers relatively quickly
  - Deep Risk – permanent loss of real capital
-	Permanent loss of capital (negative real return over a 30-year period)
    - Severe, prolonged hyperinflation – hurts stocks and bonds but bonds more
      - Wide diversification among international markets
      - A tilt toward value stocks and commodity producing companies
      - Gold bullion
      - Inflation protected securities and annuities
      - Fixed rate mortgages
  - Gold bullion protects poorly against inflation and currency shocks
  - Gold bullion does superbly with deflation
  - Gold bullion does best when the public loses faith in the financial system
  - Gold bullion is great for hyperinflation
  - PME do not protect against deflation or certain disaster scenarios like gold bullion does
  - You have to make choices as to what and how much you want to defend against
  - Stocks in the US have done best when inflation ran between 0-4%.
  - Stocks do protect against inflationary deep risk, but not in the short term. But they do protect against inflation in the long term
    - To put it another way stocks, protect against deep risk, but exacerbate shallow risk
  - Widespread diversification of stocks protects against inflation because it is unlikely that all nations would have massive hyperinflation at once
  - Inflation devastates bondholders. Especially when it is a surprise/unexpected.
 - Fixed rate mortgage payments are also good for inflation
  - A value tilt also provides protection against inflation. This worked in both domestic and international
  - Inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. But is the easiest to protect against.
    - International diversification
    - Value Tilt
    - PME
    - Natural Resource Stocks
    - Retired people should use TIPS

Skating Where the Puck Was

-	When credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - ALL OF THEM
-	Short term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction
-	Resign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. Which can be far more destructive to wealth

Rational Expectations

-	Stocks that have the potential to have high returns during crises, especially inflationary ones, should consequently have the lowest returns of all among equity classes (Like PME)
-	William Bernstein believes in 3 different industry groups for consideration into a portfolio
  1. REITs
  2. Precious Metal Equity (PME)
  3. Oil/Natural Resource Equity (NR)
-	Oil and Natural Resource stocks are a great inflation hedge and under appropriate circumstances, might not be unreasonable to have additional allocation to commodities producers
-	Don&#39;t purchase commodity futures. They are great in theory but not in practice. There used to be &quot;Backwardation&quot; in the futures market when investors were scared on deflation in their products and needed downside protection (IE a farmer selling his wheat crop in 9 months). Now inflation is the primary concern and futures contracts are in a condition known as &quot;contango&quot; which drives up the costs and reduces future returns

4 Pillars

-	PM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.

The only guide to alternative investments

-	REIT&#39;s are a great choice. But do not invest in mortgage REIT&#39;s as they are bonds and not equity
-	REIT&#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds. This is true of domestic and international
-	International REIT&#39;s can provide a benefit but their expenses tend to be higher so be careful. A 50/50 domestic and international REIT AA is a good starting place
-	Do not treat your personal home as a financial asset. It is a place to live. It should not be included in your overall AA plan
-	Investors who are not real estate professionals should gain exposure to REIT&#39;s though low-cost mutual funds and not directly buy properties as a way to achieve broad diversification
-	REIT&#39;s provide a reasonably good long-term hedge against inflation
-	5-15% is a good AA for REIT&#39;s in your portfolio
-	TIPS provide a guaranteed rate of return and are less volatile than nominal return bonds
-	TIPS have a lower correlation to equities than nominal return bonds
-	Commodities (Hard Assets) have negative correlation to stocks and bonds and act as a hedge against event risk (wars, disruptions, political instability, etc.) and inflation. Usually made up of Energy, Industrial Metals, PM, Ag, Livestock
-	CCF&#39;s do will during times of rising or unexpected inflation. But do poorly during times low or falling inflation
-	Larry Swedroe likes Collateralized commodity futures (CCF) and not the actual producers
-	William Bernstein likes commodities, but not CCF&#39;s. He likes the actual commodity producers(Example - Oil and Materials). They won&#39;t provide protection from Shallow Risk like the CCF will, but they will provide protection from deep risk.
-	PME&#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds both domestic and international
-	Excellent hedge against inflation. Especially good for retired persons who need a hedge against inflation
-	There is a large rebalancing bonus (as much as 5%)
-	PME are HIGHLY volatile so be careful and rebalance
-	PME tend to experience long periods of very low returns during periods of economic and political stability and short periods of high returns in times of crisis

Global investing

-	There is a weak negative correlation between inflation rates and stock returns
-	The short-term relation between equity returns and inflation is weak, but over the long term equity returns impound inflation rates
  - In 1920&#39;s Germany Hyperinflation, stocks hedged inflation well, but investors would have been better off if inflation didn&#39;t take place
-	The negative relation between stocks and inflation is a short to intermediate term phenomenon. Over the longer terms, stocks behave as claims to real economics assets
-	Inflation is likely to remain a factor in society, primarily because governments spend more than they receive in taxes, forcing the governments to borrow. Monetization of this debt causes inflation.
-	Over the long term, real estate should provide returns competitive with those on stocks and bonds, and its low correlation with other assets makes it valuable for diversification. Real estate has also been a superior inflation hedge
-	Commodities futures have low correlations with other assets.
  - Commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other
    - Why? Commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments
-	Gold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.
-	Commodity futures tracked inflation fairly well, but underperformed it

The delusions of crowds

-	Market Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - Technological and financial displacement
  - Credit loosening
  - Amnesia of the past
  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
-	Under most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things
  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)
  - Keeping inflation under control
    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
-	The Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true

Asset Allocation

-	No liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes
-	Governments are the primary beneficiaries of inflation, in part because of tax structures that tax nominal rather than real incomes
-	Common stocks do much better in a low inflation environment. They have performed poorly during deflation or high inflation, especially if the inflation is unexpected.
  - Over the longer run, the companies can make adjustments to inflation, but in the short run those adjustments are difficult to accomplish

A Random Walk Down Wall Street

-	Exercise 6 – Buy a house. Real estate is a great inflation hedge. REIT&#39;s are a good choice to own commercial real estate
-	Exercise 8 – Gold can have a place in your portfolio (5%). It is a good diversifier and is an excellent inflation hedge. Don&#39;t invest in diamonds or Collectibles. Buy diamonds and collectibles because you like them. Not as an investment. Do NOT invest in commodities futures contracts. You will get burned. Stay away from hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds. They are great for the managers, not for you

Stocks For the Long Run

-	Under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds
-	Because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again

-	Bonds are bad during inflation as they are fixed income investments whose cash flows are not adjusted for inflation.
  - It is also bad for the stock market. Stocks have proved to be poor hedges against inflation in the short run. But are great in the long run
-	Although fascinating to observe and understand a market&#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (CPI, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. Most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.

-	Inflation and Deflation have characterized history as far back as economists have gathered data. But since 1955, there has never been a single year in which the US consumer price index declined
-	Why the shift, because instead of Gold having control, now the government does and they always provide liquidity to prevent prices from declining
-	The market used to react more to fed policy. But investors have become so geared to watching and anticipating Fed policy that the effect of its tightening or easing is already in the market.
-	Stocks have an inflation hedge or an ability to maintain its purchasing power during periods of inflation
-	Since stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets, assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce, one should expect that their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation
-	Stock are not good hedges against inflation in the short term, but no financial asset is. In the long run however, stocks are very good hedges against inflation, while bonds are not
-	Smith&#39;s Common Stocks and Long-Term Investments showed that stocks outperform bonds in times of falling and well as rising prices.
-	Fisher found that in theory, stocks will be an ideal inflation hedge
-	If inflation rears its head again, investors will do much better in stocks than bonds

Safe Havens

-	Gold
    - Hedge against the banking system.
    - No counter party risk.
    - Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation.
      - It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices).
    - Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&#39;s.
    - Gold is all about investors&#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value.
      - It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected.
    - During the 1970&#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective.
      - Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven.
      - This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective.
      - The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.

IAA

-	REIT&#39;s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns
  - They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected

All About Asset Allocation

-	Real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bond
-	REITs have low correlation with stocks and bonds
-	Nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge. Therefore, REITs are a good inflation hedge

Physical Gold/Silver",140,0.92,56,Bogleheads,2/20/22 10:39,"seeing lots of posts about inflation recently.  thought it might be a good idea to review it and some options you have to defend against it.  and i will put my personal positions at the bottom.

from deep risk by bernstein

**deep risk – young investors series**

-	2 types of risk
  - shallow risk – loss of real capital that recovers relatively quickly
  - deep risk – permanent loss of real capital
-	permanent loss of capital (negative real return over a 30-year period)
    - severe, prolonged hyperinflation – hurts stocks and bonds but bonds more
      - wide diversification among international markets
      - a tilt toward value stocks and commodity producing companies
      - gold bullion
      - inflation protected securities and annuities
      - fixed rate mortgages
  - gold bullion protects poorly against inflation and currency shocks
  - gold bullion does superbly with deflation
  - gold bullion does best when the public loses faith in the financial system
  - gold bullion is great for hyperinflation
  - pme do not protect against deflation or certain disaster scenarios like gold bullion does
  - you have to make choices as to what and how much you want to defend against
  - stocks in the us have done best when inflation ran between 0-4%.
  - stocks do protect against inflationary deep risk, but not in the short term. but they do protect against inflation in the long term
    - to put it another way stocks, protect against deep risk, but exacerbate shallow risk
  - widespread diversification of stocks protects against inflation because it is unlikely that all nations would have massive hyperinflation at once
  - inflation devastates bondholders. especially when it is a surprise/unexpected.
 - fixed rate mortgage payments are also good for inflation
  - a value tilt also provides protection against inflation. this worked in both domestic and international
  - inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. but is the easiest to protect against.
    - international diversification
    - value tilt
    - pme
    - natural resource stocks
    - retired people should use tips

skating where the puck was

-	when credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - all of them
-	short term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction
-	resign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. which can be far more destructive to wealth

rational expectations

-	stocks that have the potential to have high returns during crises, especially inflationary ones, should consequently have the lowest returns of all among equity classes (like pme)
-	william bernstein believes in 3 different industry groups for consideration into a portfolio
  1. reits
  2. precious metal equity (pme)
  3. oil/natural resource equity (nr)
-	oil and natural resource stocks are a great inflation hedge and under appropriate circumstances, might not be unreasonable to have additional allocation to commodities producers
-	don&#39;t purchase commodity futures. they are great in theory but not in practice. there used to be &quot;backwardation&quot; in the futures market when investors were scared on deflation in their products and needed downside protection (ie a farmer selling his wheat crop in 9 months). now inflation is the primary concern and futures contracts are in a condition known as &quot;contango&quot; which drives up the costs and reduces future returns

4 pillars

-	pm funds have low expected return. but they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. pm are also a hedge against inflation. but be careful with pm. because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. you will be selling when everyone on tv is saying to buy and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.

the only guide to alternative investments

-	reit&#39;s are a great choice. but do not invest in mortgage reit&#39;s as they are bonds and not equity
-	reit&#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds. this is true of domestic and international
-	international reit&#39;s can provide a benefit but their expenses tend to be higher so be careful. a 50/50 domestic and international reit aa is a good starting place
-	do not treat your personal home as a financial asset. it is a place to live. it should not be included in your overall aa plan
-	investors who are not real estate professionals should gain exposure to reit&#39;s though low-cost mutual funds and not directly buy properties as a way to achieve broad diversification
-	reit&#39;s provide a reasonably good long-term hedge against inflation
-	5-15% is a good aa for reit&#39;s in your portfolio
-	tips provide a guaranteed rate of return and are less volatile than nominal return bonds
-	tips have a lower correlation to equities than nominal return bonds
-	commodities (hard assets) have negative correlation to stocks and bonds and act as a hedge against event risk (wars, disruptions, political instability, etc.) and inflation. usually made up of energy, industrial metals, pm, ag, livestock
-	ccf&#39;s do will during times of rising or unexpected inflation. but do poorly during times low or falling inflation
-	larry swedroe likes collateralized commodity futures (ccf) and not the actual producers
-	william bernstein likes commodities, but not ccf&#39;s. he likes the actual commodity producers(example - oil and materials). they won&#39;t provide protection from shallow risk like the ccf will, but they will provide protection from deep risk.
-	pme&#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds both domestic and international
-	excellent hedge against inflation. especially good for retired persons who need a hedge against inflation
-	there is a large rebalancing bonus (as much as 5%)
-	pme are highly volatile so be careful and rebalance
-	pme tend to experience long periods of very low returns during periods of economic and political stability and short periods of high returns in times of crisis

global investing

-	there is a weak negative correlation between inflation rates and stock returns
-	the short-term relation between equity returns and inflation is weak, but over the long term equity returns impound inflation rates
  - in 1920&#39;s germany hyperinflation, stocks hedged inflation well, but investors would have been better off if inflation didn&#39;t take place
-	the negative relation between stocks and inflation is a short to intermediate term phenomenon. over the longer terms, stocks behave as claims to real economics assets
-	inflation is likely to remain a factor in society, primarily because governments spend more than they receive in taxes, forcing the governments to borrow. monetization of this debt causes inflation.
-	over the long term, real estate should provide returns competitive with those on stocks and bonds, and its low correlation with other assets makes it valuable for diversification. real estate has also been a superior inflation hedge
-	commodities futures have low correlations with other assets.
  - commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other
    - why? commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments
-	gold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.
-	commodity futures tracked inflation fairly well, but underperformed it

the delusions of crowds

-	market bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - technological and financial displacement
  - credit loosening
  - amnesia of the past
  - abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
-	under most circumstances, the federal reserve cares about 2 things
  - overall state of the economy (as measured by gdp growth and unemployment)
  - keeping inflation under control
    - stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
-	the fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - when interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. the opposite is true

asset allocation

-	no liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes
-	governments are the primary beneficiaries of inflation, in part because of tax structures that tax nominal rather than real incomes
-	common stocks do much better in a low inflation environment. they have performed poorly during deflation or high inflation, especially if the inflation is unexpected.
  - over the longer run, the companies can make adjustments to inflation, but in the short run those adjustments are difficult to accomplish

a random walk down wall street

-	exercise 6 – buy a house. real estate is a great inflation hedge. reit&#39;s are a good choice to own commercial real estate
-	exercise 8 – gold can have a place in your portfolio (5%). it is a good diversifier and is an excellent inflation hedge. don&#39;t invest in diamonds or collectibles. buy diamonds and collectibles because you like them. not as an investment. do not invest in commodities futures contracts. you will get burned. stay away from hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds. they are great for the managers, not for you

stocks for the long run

-	under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&#39;s. under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds
-	because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again

-	bonds are bad during inflation as they are fixed income investments whose cash flows are not adjusted for inflation.
  - it is also bad for the stock market. stocks have proved to be poor hedges against inflation in the short run. but are great in the long run
-	although fascinating to observe and understand a market&#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (cpi, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.

-	inflation and deflation have characterized history as far back as economists have gathered data. but since 1955, there has never been a single year in which the us consumer price index declined
-	why the shift, because instead of gold having control, now the government does and they always provide liquidity to prevent prices from declining
-	the market used to react more to fed policy. but investors have become so geared to watching and anticipating fed policy that the effect of its tightening or easing is already in the market.
-	stocks have an inflation hedge or an ability to maintain its purchasing power during periods of inflation
-	since stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets, assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce, one should expect that their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation
-	stock are not good hedges against inflation in the short term, but no financial asset is. in the long run however, stocks are very good hedges against inflation, while bonds are not
-	smith&#39;s common stocks and long-term investments showed that stocks outperform bonds in times of falling and well as rising prices.
-	fisher found that in theory, stocks will be an ideal inflation hedge
-	if inflation rears its head again, investors will do much better in stocks than bonds

safe havens

-	gold
    - hedge against the banking system.
    - no counter party risk.
    - historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. but, is a very noisy hedge against inflation.
      - it is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (when inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices).
    - mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&#39;s.
    - gold is all about investors&#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value.
      - it is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected.
    - during the 1970&#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective.
      - gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven.
      - this means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective.
      - the amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.

savnly,captmorgan50,Winning the Loser's Game by Charles Ellis Book Summary,"# Winning the Loser&#39;s Game by Charles Ellis

- Investment managers are not beating the market, the market is beating them
  - Over 1 year, 70% of professionals underperform their benchmarks
  - Over 10 years, 80%
  - Over 15 years, 90%
- Yes, some professional money managers will beat the market in any given year. But most will not over the long term and there is no reliable way to figure out who would be in that 10% that outperforms ahead of time
  - Individuals investing on their own do even worse and individuals who day trade do the worst of all on average
- In the 1960&#39;s, when active investing was a winner&#39;s game, individuals did 90% of the trading and institutions did 10%.
  - Professionals could beat the amateurs easily.
- Professional money managers now do 95% of the trading on wall street now.
  - They are so good as a group that they make it nearly impossible for any one of them to outperform the market. They don&#39;t make enough errors for their peers to exploit.
- Although figuring out the optimal investment policy can be difficult, the hardest part of investing is staying committed to a sound investment policy
  - Being rational in an emotional environment is not easy
    - Develop your plan and stick with it
- Active investing is, at the margin, always a negative sum game
- Just because a manger had success in the past, does not mean he will have success in the future
- To be a long-term winner, set realistic goals and develop sensible investment polies that will achieve those objectives and then have the discipline and fortitude require to implement those policy&#39;s
- The only way active investment managers can beat the market, after adjusting for market risk, is to discover and exploit other active investors mistakes and overcome the high costs of fees
- Active investors have 3 ways of doing this
  - Timing
  - Selecting specific stocks or groups of stocks
  - Making timely changes in overall portfolio structure or strategy
    - Market timing is a truly wicked idea, don&#39;t try it
    - The only way to beat the market is to beat the professionals who, as a group, are the market. The problem isn&#39;t the research isn&#39;t done well. It is that the research is done well by so many
- Although the market isn&#39;t perfectly efficient, its not longer worth the real costs of trying to beat it. If you can&#39;t beat them, join them and buy index funds.
  - Stock markets are different than they were 60 years ago (1960&#39;s)
  - Indexing outperforms active investing
  - Index investing is low cost
- The daily weather is comparably different than the climate. Weather is about the short run. Climate is about the long run. This applies to finance too. Ignore the short term and focus on the long term.
- Gravity is a powerful force. A powerful force in finance is regression to the mean. This is the tendency of a series of events to become more normal or average over time
  - As Example – Very hot or very cold days tend to be followed by less hot or cold days
  - The same &quot;back toward normal&quot; occurs with P/E multiples
    - Stocks with very high or low P/E ratios tend to move back toward normal. Causing a double whammy!
  - The power of regression to the mean is valuable. Don&#39;t get caught up in the hype either positive or negative as an investor.
- Investing is not supposed to be fun or exciting
  - Stick to your plan as an investor and ignore the noise is the secret to long term success
- Indexing has lower fees, lower taxes and lower operating expenses
  - Using an index fund allows the investors to keep pace with the market virtually without effort
- Warren Buffett recommends most investors consider indexing
- Indexing advantage
  - Less Taxes
  - Less Fees
  - Less Costs
  - More peace of mind
- Study after study shows index investing works
- Index investing &quot;unfair&quot; advantages
  - Higher rates of return
  - Lower management fees and expenses
  - Lower taxes
  - Lower transaction costs
  - Lower portfolio turnover
  - Convenience
- The case for indexing increases as the period lengthens
- To minimize risk relative to return or to maximize return relative to risk, investors should consider at least diversifying internationally.
  - 50/50 US/Foreign is a good starting point
- Investors who decide to concentrate their investments in their home country are making an implicit decision to emphasize that one country over others. Curiously, most investors do just that. British investors favor UK, Canadian investors favor Canada, Japanese investors favor Japan, American investors prefer USA.
- The more turnover in a portfolio, the more taxes and the lower accumulated returns
- Investors essential truth &quot;We have met the enemy and he is us.&quot;
- Behavioral Economics
  - We fail to appreciate the power of regression to the mean
  - We ignore the normal pattern of experience
  - We believe in &quot;hot hands&quot;
  - We overreact to first impressions and then anchor to those views
  - We suffer from illusion of control
  - We rely on expert opinions and are overconfident in those opinions
  - We overestimate out own skill and knowledge
  - We respond to the &quot;halo effect&quot; of a recommendation of someone we admire, like a celebrity or athlete
  - We are overly impressed by short term results
  - We are &quot;confirmation biased&quot; looking for and then overweighting the data that supports our conclusion
  - We anchor too much to our initial opinion
  - We confuse familiarity with knowledge and understanding
  - We overreact to both good and bad news
  - We think we know more relative to what others know than we really do
- Investors risks to avoid
  - Trying too hard and taking too much risk
  - Not trying hard enough, usually by having too much cash or money market accounts
  - Being Impatient
  - Changing mutual funds too much (holding less than 10 years)
  - Borrowing too much
    - 3 out of 4 fortunes that are lost got lost because borrowed money was used
  - Being naively optimistic
  - Being proud
    - We overestimate our own ability
  - Being emotional
    - We are happy when our stocks go up and sad when they go down. And the feelings are stronger the faster the change in prices
- Given enough time, investments that might otherwise seem unattractive become highly desirable, and vice versa.
- The longer the time period over which an investment is held, the closer the actual returns in a portfolio will come to the expected average
- If a time period is abundantly long, a wise investor can commit without great anxiety to investments that in the short run would appear too risky
- The single most important dimension of your investment policy is the asset mix. Specifically, your equity and fixed income. Analysis shows repeatedly that the tradeoff between risk and reward is driven by one key factor: time.
- If the market has been going up, investors, who curiously usually evaluate future prospects by looking into rearview mirror, will assume some further upward momentum.
- And if the market has been going down, investors will assume further downward momentum.
  - The wise investor will adjust for this notorious human tendency
- History of return on investments show 3 key points
  - Common stocks have average returns that are higher than bonds. Bonds have higher returns than short term money market instruments
  - The fluctuations of actual returns on common stocks exceed the fluctuations on bonds, which in turn exceed the fluctuations on short term instruments
  - The magnitude of fluctuations in rate of return increases as the measurement period is shortened and decreases as it is lengthened.
- This means rates of return appear more normal over longer periods of time
- Develop an investment policy for yourself and then follow it
- Too often investment policy is too vague and is left to be resolved in haste when distressing market conditions are present. This is when it is too easy to make the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.
- The best shield against the disruption of the markets short term provocations is understanding and knowledge.
- Put your investment policy in writing so you will follow it when times are bad
- When the market drops, we stop buying and, in fact, usually start selling. And when the market rises, we buy more and more enthusiastically.
- We are wrong when we feel good about stocks having gone up and we are wrong when we feel bad about stocks having gone down
- A knowledge of yourself and history prevents panic during these times
- Every investor can be a winner
  - Ignore the &quot;beat the market&quot; hype
- Each investor must decide what are investment policies that they can and will stay with through thick and thin over the long term
- If your investment policy is not determined through carefully developed understanding, it will be determined by improvisation
- The markets specialty of short-term focus is the mortal enemy of long-term investment success
- Over very long periods, the average return obtained by most actively managed mutual funds must be expected to be close to the market average minus 1.5% for various costs
- The average mutual fund investor actually gets a return that is significantly below the average return that they invest in
- Why? Frequent trading in and out of funds and chasing performance instead of staying the course
- Index investing advantages
  - Anyone trying to beat the market faces an increasingly formidable challenge
  - Operating costs are far lower than active investments
  - Taxes are lower due to decreased turnover
  - Fees are much lower
  - Easier to stay on plan
  - More time for other activities
- Investment professionals daily trading volume by decade
  - 10% in the 1960&#39;s to over 90% currently.
- This is why it is so difficult for active managers to beat the market
- Understanding the outlook for the near term is easy as J.P Morgan said, &quot;It will fluctuate.&quot;
- One way to be realistic about future returns is to assume that future range of P/E multiples and corporate profits will be within their historical upper and lower limits and will appear with frequency at values close to the long-term average
- Investors almost always project recent past market and economic behavior out into the future, somehow expecting more of the same to continue
  - Math example – If dividends are at 1.5% and corporate earnings are growing at 4.5% (Historical Average), then a composite of 6% return is reasonable. This is the fundamental rate of return the investor can expect from the market
  - Then you add or subtract the changes in P/E over that time frame. The average P/E in recent decades has been about 15.5. This is the speculative return component
- Predicting the market roughly is not hard, but predicting it accurately is impossible
  - Predicting where the market will be in the long run is not hard, but even estimating how it will move in the next few months is impossible and pointless
- Investing must always begin with savings. No savings means no investing
- Having a defensive saving reserve is a must. Just like a fire extinguisher
- 10 Commandments for individual investors
  - Save
  - If you must &quot;play&quot; in the market, do it will a small portion of your money
  - Don&#39;t do anything in investing primarily for tax reasons
  - Don&#39;t think of your home as an investment
  - Don&#39;t do commodities
  - Don&#39;t get confused by stockbrokers and salespeople
  - Don&#39;t invest in novel or unusual kinds of investments
  - Don&#39;t invest in bonds just because you heard they are safe. Bond prices fluctuate and are a very poor defense against the major risk of long-term investing: inflation.
  - Write out your long-term goals and have an investment plan in place
  - Distrust your feelings
- Your responsibility is to decide on your long-term investment objective and determine a reasoned and realistic set of investment policies that can achieve your objectives
- The individual investor does not have to beat the market to be successful
- Warren Buffett &quot;Investing is simple, but it&#39;s not easy.&quot;
- The real challenge is to commit to the discipline of long-term investing and avoid reacting to the short-term distractions
- Winning the loser&#39;s game of beating the market is easy: DO NOT TRY IT!!
- Index your investments
- The real purpose of investment management is not to beat the market; it is to do what is right for each particular investor who accepts the responsibility of defining their true and realistic investment objectives, developing sensible long-term policies, and staying with them.",140,0.98,31,Bogleheads,1/23/22 10:09,"# winning the loser&#39;s game by charles ellis

  - more peace of mind
- study after study shows index investing works
- index investing &quot;unfair&quot; advantages
  - higher rates of return
  - lower management fees and expenses
  - lower taxes
  - lower transaction costs
  - lower portfolio turnover
  - convenience
- the case for indexing increases as the period lengthens
- to minimize risk relative to return or to maximize return relative to risk, investors should consider at least diversifying internationally.
  - 50/50 us/foreign is a good starting point
- investors who decide to concentrate their investments in their home country are making an implicit decision to emphasize that one country over others. curiously, most investors do just that. british investors favor uk, canadian investors favor canada, japanese investors favor japan, american investors prefer usa.
- the more turnover in a portfolio, the more taxes and the lower accumulated returns
- investors essential truth &quot;we have met the enemy and he is us.&quot;
- behavioral economics
  - we fail to appreciate the power of regression to the mean
  - we ignore the normal pattern of experience
  - we believe in &quot;hot hands&quot;
  - we overreact to first impressions and then anchor to those views
  - we suffer from illusion of control
  - we rely on expert opinions and are overconfident in those opinions
  - we overestimate out own skill and knowledge
  - we respond to the &quot;halo effect&quot; of a recommendation of someone we admire, like a celebrity or athlete
  - we are overly impressed by short term results
  - we are &quot;confirmation biased&quot; looking for and then overweighting the data that supports our conclusion
  - we anchor too much to our initial opinion
  - we confuse familiarity with knowledge and understanding
  - we overreact to both good and bad news
  - we think we know more relative to what others know than we really do
- investors risks to avoid
  - trying too hard and taking too much risk
  - not trying hard enough, usually by having too much cash or money market accounts
  - being impatient
  - changing mutual funds too much (holding less than 10 years)
  - borrowing too much
    - 3 out of 4 fortunes that are lost got lost because borrowed money was used
  - being naively optimistic
  - being proud
    - we overestimate our own ability
  - being emotional
    - we are happy when our stocks go up and sad when they go down. and the feelings are stronger the faster the change in prices
- given enough time, investments that might otherwise seem unattractive become highly desirable, and vice versa.
- the longer the time period over which an investment is held, the closer the actual returns in a portfolio will come to the expected average
- if a time period is abundantly long, a wise investor can commit without great anxiety to investments that in the short run would appear too risky
- the single most important dimension of your investment policy is the asset mix. specifically, your equity and fixed income. analysis shows repeatedly that the tradeoff between risk and reward is driven by one key factor: time.
- if the market has been going up, investors, who curiously usually evaluate future prospects by looking into rearview mirror, will assume some further upward momentum.
- and if the market has been going down, investors will assume further downward momentum.
  - the wise investor will adjust for this notorious human tendency
- history of return on investments show 3 key points
  - common stocks have average returns that are higher than bonds. bonds have higher returns than short term money market instruments
  - the fluctuations of actual returns on common stocks exceed the fluctuations on bonds, which in turn exceed the fluctuations on short term instruments
  - the magnitude of fluctuations in rate of return increases as the measurement period is shortened and decreases as it is lengthened.
- this means rates of return appear more normal over longer periods of time
- develop an investment policy for yourself and then follow it
- too often investment policy is too vague and is left to be resolved in haste when distressing market conditions are present. this is when it is too easy to make the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.
- the best shield against the disruption of the markets short term provocations is understanding and knowledge.
- put your investment policy in writing so you will follow it when times are bad
- when the market drops, we stop buying and, in fact, usually start selling. and when the market rises, we buy more and more enthusiastically.
- we are wrong when we feel good about stocks having gone up and we are wrong when we feel bad about stocks having gone down
- a knowledge of yourself and history prevents panic during these times
- every investor can be a winner
  - ignore the &quot;beat the market&quot; hype
- each investor must decide what are investment policies that they can and will stay with through thick and thin over the long term
- if your investment policy is not determined through carefully developed understanding, it will be determined by improvisation
- the markets specialty of short-term focus is the mortal enemy of long-term investment success
- over very long periods, the average return obtained by most actively managed mutual funds must be expected to be close to the market average minus 1.5% for various costs
- the average mutual fund investor actually gets a return that is significantly below the average return that they invest in
- why? frequent trading in and out of funds and chasing performance instead of staying the course
- index investing advantages
  - anyone trying to beat the market faces an increasingly formidable challenge
  - operating costs are far lower than active investments
  - taxes are lower due to decreased turnover
  - fees are much lower
  - easier to stay on plan
  - more time for other activities
- investment professionals daily trading volume by decade
  - 10% in the 1960&#39;s to over 90% currently.
- this is why it is so difficult for active managers to beat the market
- understanding the outlook for the near term is easy as j.p morgan said, &quot;it will fluctuate.&quot;
- one way to be realistic about future returns is to assume that future range of p/e multiples and corporate profits will be within their historical upper and lower limits and will appear with frequency at values close to the long-term average
- investors almost always project recent past market and economic behavior out into the future, somehow expecting more of the same to continue
  - math example – if dividends are at 1.5% and corporate earnings are growing at 4.5% (historical average), then a composite of 6% return is reasonable. this is the fundamental rate of return the investor can expect from the market
  - then you add or subtract the changes in p/e over that time frame. the average p/e in recent decades has been about 15.5. this is the speculative return component
- predicting the market roughly is not hard, but predicting it accurately is impossible
  - predicting where the market will be in the long run is not hard, but even estimating how it will move in the next few months is impossible and pointless
- investing must always begin with savings. no savings means no investing
- having a defensive saving reserve is a must. just like a fire extinguisher
- 10 commandments for individual investors
  - save
  - if you must &quot;play&quot; in the market, do it will a small portion of your money
  - don&#39;t do anything in investing primarily for tax reasons
  - don&#39;t think of your home as an investment
  - don&#39;t do commodities
  - don&#39;t get confused by stockbrokers and salespeople
  - don&#39;t invest in novel or unusual kinds of investments
  - don&#39;t invest in bonds just because you heard they are safe. bond prices fluctuate and are a very poor defense against the major risk of long-term investing: inflation.
  - write out your long-term goals and have an investment plan in place
  - distrust your feelings
- your responsibility is to decide on your long-term investment objective and determine a reasoned and realistic set of investment policies that can achieve your objectives
- the individual investor does not have to beat the market to be successful
- warren buffett &quot;investing is simple, but it&#39;s not easy.&quot;
- the real challenge is to commit to the discipline of long-term investing and avoid reacting to the short-term distractions
- winning the loser&#39;s game of beating the market is easy: do not try it!!
- index your investments
- the real purpose of investment management is not to beat the market; it is to do what is right for each particular investor who accepts the responsibility of defining their true and realistic investment objectives, developing sensible long-term policies, and staying with them."

\[Edit\] My question about what to do is about what to do with investments, not activities, but thanks for activities suggestions all the same.

My situation:

10 years into retirement

Defined benefit pension and SS cover all of my expenses for now, with a bit left over to save/invest. Pension is not indexed. Inflation will eventually reduce its value. The way things are going, eventually may not be a real long time.

Substantial investment savings in 401K, Roth, taxable accounts - mid six-figures - Bogle-ish invested in US stocks:Ex-US stocks:Bonds:Cash 34:11:34:20. I know this is not optimum. I just adjusted some recently when I evaluated and found I was 56% in cash.

Plenty of emergency funds for expenses - don't need much I'm never going to be laid off/unemployed with no income.

Plenty of cash savings for a car, roof replacement, HVAC replacement, etc. I prefer to have money saved for this sort of thing rather than loans when they happen. Car is about time to replace, but it is a terrible time to buy one.

I have received my inheritances. This is the end. I will never receive any new money so capital preservation is a concern. Received them recently. Currently mid six-figures parked in HYSA cash.

No debt or other obligations

I grew up poor-ish and am constitutionally frugal. I can't change that. I don't enjoy travel beyond an hour or so in the car. It's painful to sit in a fixed position for long.

My greatest joy in retirement is not having to wake up to a screeching alarm clock. Pretty pathetic, I know, but it's my little slice of joy.

What am I supposed to do investment wise? I know the 4-5% scheme to withdraw from investments for life, but I don't need to withdraw now, or maybe for years, other than 401K RMDs coming in a few years. Even then I would probably reinvest most or all in the taxable account.",137,0.94,42,Bogleheads,3/8/22 16:50,"everything i see here is about how 20-40-somethings to save/invest for retirement. what are we supposed to do once retirement comes. i don't see anything in the sidebar links.

108gsmz,bigcockmoney69,Beware of keeping a savings account with Marcus (Goldman Sachs),"I've just dealt with a customer service experience that I hope no one has to go through, so let me help you avoid it by telling you what happened.

I opened a high yield savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs about a month ago, intending to stash my emergency fund there. I also had some extra funds that I was planning to use in the new year to contribute to my HSA and IRA (with fidelity).

When January came, I initiated a transfer of $3,850 from Marcus to my HSA and immediately put it into VT. Happy to have fully funded my HSA for the year, I closed the app and went on with my day. Set it and forget it.

At the end of last week--Friday at 9:31pm to be exact--I get an e-mail from Marcus saying they tried to reach me, locked my account, and reversed the transfer. Of course I opened the e-mail after 10pm, which is when they closed for the day. I checked my missed calls and there was no sign of them having reached out.

Now after a 3-hour long call to customer service, it looks like my VT position will be liquidated and it's unclear whether or not I will be able to contribute to my HSA at all this year, since I technically already contributed the max.

All of this, because I had the audacity to transfer my own money from Marcus. The funny thing is I opened the account for liquidity purposes--thinking it would allow me to make quick and easy online transfers when I needed to. Won't make that mistake again. When I sort this out I'll be closing my account with Marcus and using a Fidelity money market to house my emergency fund.

mk9as9,bfwolf1,Where are the posts asking about how to save more money?,"I'm a middle aged dude which makes me a very old head on this sub.  One thing that strikes me is that the vast majority of posts are about how to invest.  ""What should I do with $5,000"" and the like.  For the younger folk just starting their careers, who make up the vast majority of this sub, those investment questions are relatively unimportant.  Whether you put $5,000 in VT or put it in some actively managed mutual fund is not going to make a ton of difference in 40 years.  20 years from now, when you've got a million dollars, how you should invest it becomes a very salient question.  But the only way to get to a million dollars in 20 years is to save a ton.  So where are the questions on that?

Do you guys think you've got it figured out?  Or you're not sure what to ask?

Or maybe you don't think this is the place to ask?  It is!  The Boglehead philosophy is about more than investing.  It's really around accumulating enough money to achieve your financial goals, and saving is the most important of that.  So questions about how to increase your income and/or decrease your expenses are fair game.

Operators are standing by.  I'm ready to lend my (limited) wisdom on the subject, and I think you can get a lot of great ideas here from your own age cohort too.  So let's have them!

Edit: A few salient points have been brought up in the comments that I thought I'd address.

1. **There are other subs for that**.  This is a great point and like an idiot I hadn't even considered it.  I guess the question is whether r/Bogleheads is just a place to discuss asset location and allocation and other subs are for discussing other parts of personal finance *or* whether r/Bogleheads is a community of like-minded people who can elevate the quality of discussion for all personal finance matters.
2. **I can't believe you're saying it doesn't matter whether you invest in index funds or actively managed funds.**  I want to be very clear that I am not saying that.  What I *am* saying is that for a one-time investment of $5,000, it's not going to make a huge difference whether your expense ratio is 1% or 0.1% because $5,000 just isn't enough money.  Obviously getting in the habit of investing in diversified index funds is an awesome thing and will pay dividends in the long run *if* you are able to save enough money to make it meaningful.  The biggest opportunity you have to make a meaningful difference in your earning ability is when you're young.  This sub's demos are perfect for those kinds of discussions.
3. **Just telling people to spend less is tired advice.** When I say save more, I don't mean spend less.  I mean some combination of spend less and earn more.  For most young people, earning more is generally a much more effective strategy.
4. **Telling people to earn more is also tired advice.** I agree that telling someone to earn more and leaving it at that is tired advice.  I'm interested in having in-depth discussions about HOW to earn more.  Specific strategies for people with specific situations.

I thought it also might be useful to tell my own life story and highlight the good and bad decisions I made throughout.  So here goes.

I was a bright kid and got into my state's excellent flagship university in the mid 90s.  I also got into another state's excellent flagship university.  I almost went to the out-of-state university but came to my senses at the last minute and went to the in-state university.  I have no idea what I was thinking when I was considering the out-of-state school or why my parents were going to let an 18 year old make such an important decision.

When I was a freshman, I considered majoring in computer science.  I took a couple of courses and decided I absolutely hated it.  Obviously computer science would've been a lucrative major, but I think I made the right decision not going into something I loathed.  On the other hand, I ended up majoring in history which was just dumb.  I have a good head for business and finance--I should have either majored in business (if I could've gotten into the undergrad biz school, which is dubious) or economics.  Some folks think college is a place to explore your passions, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but I also think people need to view it as a career stepping stone.

Pursuant to this idea that I wasn't thinking about my career when I was in college, I didn't get any Summer jobs.  No internships.  Never once talked to the career office.  What the hell was I thinking?  I took classes during the Summer instead and graduated in 3 years.  With no job prospects.  I ended up moving back in with my mom and lazing around the house for 6 months before a family friend hired me to do some crappy entry level job for $10 an hour.

I got promoted at the company to a slightly less crappy job and by puffing up that experience as much as possible on my application, combined with good grades and an excellent GMAT, I was able to get into exactly 1 of the 4 top MBA programs I applied to.  This was my big break in life.  If that fourth school had rejected me as well, I don't know how it would've turned out.  I mean, I would've kept applying every year, but my job experience was really crummy.  I got lucky in a big way.

I got a job out of biz school at a megacompany doing marketing and general management.  My pre-MBA salary was $32,000 a year.  My post-MBA salary was $78,000 a year.  This changed everything.  I went from living paycheck to paycheck to saving oodles of money.  I was able to get promoted a couple of times at my new company and by my mid 30s I was making \~$200,000 in total compensation.  In my mind, I was really not that frugal during this time period.  But compared to my high earning friends, I definitely was.  So I saved a ton of money over a 12 year career and invested it religiously.  At the end of the 12 years, I had about a million dollars.

Part way through that 12 year career, I discovered [Bogleheads.org](https://Bogleheads.org) and adjusted my investment strategy accordingly.  This was a positive change though I'm not sure it made a huge difference in my money situation since I think I was just dumping the money into target retirement funds before that so was doing just fine.

I am a smart guy and was decent at my job, but I can also be hard-headed.  I was never what one would call a ""boss pleaser.""  I felt like my duty was to the shareholders, not my boss.  This is a terribly impractical and losing career strategy and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Please your boss!!!  I also didn't work as hard as some of my peers.  Eventually, I was laid off.

Fortunately, I had started up a side hustle about 3 years before being laid off.  It was still pretty small-time, but I was ready to give it a go because I hated corporate America and I had enough of a financial cushion to try it out.  It's worked out!  I make WAY less than I used to, but I've also cut expenses.  I'm not the kind of person who is interested in ""things,"" so that helps.  I have tons of flexibility and travel the world a ton.  I can work wherever I have my laptop.  I work a lot less than I did in corporate America, too.  In the beginning, I was taking out maybe 2% per year from my nest egg per year to cover the shortfall between my income and my expenses, but I'm now at the point where my income covers my expenses fully.  I don't have a family to support which helps tremendously.  I've got somewhere in the range of \~$1.5M in assets and have it invested 75% stocks/25% bonds.  I'm at the point where I'm cruising along and letting the market do the hard work of growing my money while I just need to make enough money to cover my expenses and enjoy life.  It's a really good place to be.

So anyway, that's my story.  Maybe there are some parts of it that would inspire somebody to ask a question to help them in their own life?",167,0.86,98,Bogleheads,4/4/21 21:09,"i'm a middle aged dude which makes me a very old head on this sub.  one thing that strikes me is that the vast majority of posts are about how to invest.

2. **i can't believe you're saying it doesn't matter whether you invest in index funds or actively managed funds.**  i want to be very clear that i am not saying that.  what i *am* saying is that for a one-time investment of $5,000, it's not going to make a huge difference whether your expense ratio is 1% or 0.1% because $5,000 just isn't enough money.  obviously getting in the habit of investing in diversified index funds is an awesome thing and will pay dividends in the long run *if* you are able to save enough money to make it meaningful.  the biggest opportunity you have to make a meaningful difference in your earning ability is when you're young.  this sub's demos are perfect for those kinds of discussions.
3. **just telling people to spend less is tired advice.** when i say save more, i don't mean spend less.  i mean some combination of spend less and earn more.  for most young people, earning more is generally a much more effective strategy.
4. **telling people to earn more is also tired advice.** i agree that telling someone to earn more and leaving it at that is tired advice.  i'm interested in having in-depth discussions about how to earn more.  specific strategies for people with specific situations.

i thought it also might be useful to tell my own life story and highlight the good and bad decisions i made throughout.  so here goes.

i was a bright kid and got into my state's excellent flagship university in the mid 90s.  i also got into another state's excellent flagship university.  i almost went to the out-of-state university but came to my senses at the last minute and went to the in-state university.  i have no idea what i was thinking when i was considering the out-of-state school or why my parents were going to let an 18 year old make such an important decision.

when i was a freshman, i considered majoring in computer science.  i took a couple of courses and decided i absolutely hated it.  obviously computer science would've been a lucrative major, but i think i made the right decision not going into something i loathed.  on the other hand, i ended up majoring in history which was just dumb.  i have a good head for business and finance--i should have either majored in business (if i could've gotten into the undergrad biz school, which is dubious) or economics.  some folks think college is a place to explore your passions, and i don't think there's anything wrong with that, but i also think people need to view it as a career stepping stone.

pursuant to this idea that i wasn't thinking about my career when i was in college, i didn't get any summer jobs.  no internships.  never once talked to the career office.  what the hell was i thinking?  i took classes during the summer instead and graduated in 3 years.  with no job prospects.  i ended up moving back in with my mom and lazing around the house for 6 months before a family friend hired me to do some crappy entry level job for $10 an hour.

i got promoted at the company to a slightly less crappy job and by puffing up that experience as much as possible on my application, combined with good grades and an excellent gmat, i was able to get into exactly 1 of the 4 top mba programs i applied to.  this was my big break in life.  if that fourth school had rejected me as well, i don't know how it would've turned out.  i mean, i would've kept applying every year, but my job experience was really crummy.  i got lucky in a big way.

i got a job out of biz school at a megacompany doing marketing and general management.  my pre-mba salary was $32,000 a year.  my post-mba salary was $78,000 a year.  this changed everything.  i went from living paycheck to paycheck to saving oodles of money.  i was able to get promoted a couple of times at my new company and by my mid 30s i was making \~$200,000 in total compensation.  in my mind, i was really not that frugal during this time period.  but compared to my high earning friends, i definitely was.  so i saved a ton of money over a 12 year career and invested it religiously.  at the end of the 12 years, i had about a million dollars.

part way through that 12 year career, i discovered [bogleheads.org](https://bogleheads.org) and adjusted my investment strategy accordingly.  this was a positive change though i'm not sure it made a huge difference in my money situation since i think i was just dumping the money into target retirement funds before that so was doing just fine.

i am a smart guy and was decent at my job, but i can also be hard-headed.  i was never what one would call a ""boss pleaser.""  i felt like my duty was to the shareholders, not my boss.  this is a terribly impractical and losing career strategy and i would not recommend it to anyone.  please your boss!!!  i also didn't work as hard as some of my peers.  eventually, i was laid off.

fortunately, i had started up a side hustle about 3 years before being laid off.  it was still pretty small-time, but i was ready to give it a go because i hated corporate america and i had enough of a financial cushion to try it out.  it's worked out!  i make way less than i used to, but i've also cut expenses.  i'm not the kind of person who is interested in ""things,"" so that helps.  i have tons of flexibility and travel the world a ton.  i can work wherever i have my laptop.  i work a lot less than i did in corporate america, too.  in the beginning, i was taking out maybe 2% per year from my nest egg per year to cover the shortfall between my income and my expenses, but i'm now at the point where my income covers my expenses fully.  i don't have a family to support which helps tremendously.  i've got somewhere in the range of \~$1.5m in assets and have it invested 75% stocks/25% bonds.  i'm at the point where i'm cruising along and letting the market do the hard work of growing my money while i just need to make enough money to cover my expenses and enjoy life.  it's a really good place to be.

so anyway, that's my story.  maybe there are some parts of it that would inspire somebody to ask a question to help them in their own life?"

vwkh9q,bemusedly,A Cautionary Tale about Mutual Funds,"I've been helping my retired mom with her finances, and we went through her investment statements and taxes together. The question she had was why she was hit with double her normal tax bill this year. Her tax bill was so unexpectedly high that she had to sell stock to pay it, which of course will incur even more taxes.

It turned out she was heavily invested (\~$1.4mil) in actively managed mutual funds with a moderately high expense ratio (.38-.52%) and high portfolio turnover (\~25%), in a taxable account. On top of this she is paying an advisory fee that adds up to about $20k per year, and, most concerning, these funds are doing noticeably worse than the S&P500.

The main culprit lay in her capital gains distributions, which by itself was approx $120,000. This is different from the capital gains you have when you sell stock in your portfolio - distributions are generated by mutual funds when they sell stocks within the mutual fund. This is less of an issue for passive index funds, but for active funds it can result in what we saw in my mom's 1099: a capital gains distribution that can vary wildly from year to year depending on what the fund's managers decide to buy and sell. You have no control over this, and you get hit with the tax bill. You don't even get free money like dividends when this happens. It's literally just Wall Street fat cats making deals and passing the tax bill on to you. 

Do the math: 15% long term capital gains tax rate on $120k means she had to pay $18,000 in taxes on JUST the distributions, not even including any other sources of income. The real thorn in the side is that these distributions added nothing to her checking account - it was set to auto-reinvest, so she is paying $18,000 to reinvest in crappy active mutual funds THAT ARE UNDERPERFORMING THE S&P500!!! 

Lesson learned: Don't put mutual funds in a taxable account, especially active ones, especially ones with high turnover (which results in high distributions). There is a good reason Vanguard developed a proprietary way of hiding distributions in their mutual funds.",310,0.96,77,Bogleheads,7/11/22 11:00,"i've been helping my retired mom with her finances, and we went through her investment statements and taxes together. the question she had was why she was hit with double her normal tax bill this year. her tax bill was so unexpectedly high that she had to sell stock to pay it, which of course will incur even more taxes.

13ay6se,baby__steps,An update on my journey - it’s been an humbling experience,"After 9.5 months, I've paid off my credit card debt totaling $44k. All I have left now is ~$14k car payment with monthly payments of $250 at 3%. 

I am greatly relieved now and will focus on savings, investing, and retirement. I plan to buy a comfortable primary home within the next couple of years. 

Info from my post last year - over the years, saving for the future/retirement was out of mind and sight (significantly behind). Keeping up with the Joneses, being financially illiterate, financially irresponsible, raising two children, separation/break-up, living in the moment, and starting a new career while moving up the corporate ladder contributed to all this.

13qytik,averagecounselor,Starting at 30.,"Hey Y'all. 

I am going to start investing at 30. I am extremely far behind it seems. Here is a quick write up regarding my situation.

Graduated Debt free. (B.A. in History). Decided to leave my 52K a year salary state job to serve in the Peace Corps in 2019. Served 1 year in Country evacuated due to COVID. 2020 to 2021  Returned to a similar role at the State level. (55K) Left said role to teach in Guatemala in 2021 to 2022. 

I returned last September and quickly started working to build up my savings once again. 

As it stands: 20K in Savings (10K emergency fund/ 10k Savings) 

6K in investments (90% Cruiseline stock. I am down 30% all across the board. Holding until the day that it reaches pre-pandemic prices) (well a man can dream)

$700 invested in Polka Dot. (Im up 67% as if right now) 

Other: 

Checking $1200

Travel: $1500 (I like to travel and I have a separate account that I utilize for that. I came back from a recent 2 month trip in Guatemala/ Mexico so I started it from scratch once again) 

State Pension: I have $2000-$3000 in CALPERS. I opted not to withdraw it as I figured I would return to work for the State of California one day. 

\------------------------------------------------

Employment: I am not making anywhere near as much as I was fresh out of college. But I am no longer making $700 a month like I was when I taught in Guatemala. Right now I am doing contract work as a substitute teacher. 

My Goal is to switch to permanent employment at the County/ State Level. 

I would like to start maxing out a retirement account now and go from there. 

If I understand this correctly: I need to open up a Roth IRA and focus on VTI and VXUS? Ideally max these out each month for the next 30 years or so. 

Is that it? My Plan is to kick start off my IRA with 10K from my Savings and go from there. 

Is there anything that I am missing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",141,0.89,88,Bogleheads,5/24/23 17:46,"hey y'all.

15eu4uf,armadillo_antarillo,How the US manages to outperform ex-US (not),"Edit: for those interested, I posted [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/15fog7m/how_the_us_manages_to_outperform_exus_not_part_2/), which looks at outperformance magnitudes as well :)

Recently, there's been a lot of discussion around how US outperforms ex-US in \~all backtests with available data, such as:

* [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/15dt3ej/tell_me_why_im_wrong_on_international_investing/) by /u/ComeAndSee-_-

* [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/15c525n/can_someone_help_with_this_backtest/) by /u/SafetyMammoth8118

* many other posts that question VT, or international diversification entirely

I tagged the OP's because I think this will be of interest to them.

I'm personally quite interested in this matter as well, and being a data-driven guy, I checked and verified that indeed, for the available raw data, US outperformed ex-US consistently, and it's not just because of the last decade.

There are a lot of resources that explain the importance of international diversification, but many do not provide raw data or convincing arguments (e.g., they put forth a single backtest over a period of 50 years, or one backtest for each decade, to show that US and ex-US take turns in outperforming, but these arguments are just as prone to ""start/end-date picking"" as the ones in favor of US outperformance).

So I took matters in my own hands and went on a data analysis quest. Credit Suisse published this [awesome global market cap graph](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/news-and-expertise/global-investment-returns-yearbook-2023-202302/_jcr_content/content/image_922424839/image.revampimg.1428.medium.jpg/evolution-of-equity-markets-since-1900.jpg) in their public 2023 yearbook. I reverse-engineered it and computed the US global market cap for all years from 1900 to 2020.

For any given period of time, the US outperforms ex-US if and only if the US market cap at the end is greater than at the start (pretty easy to prove on paper).

For a given period of time (e.g., 1920-2020) and a specific investment horizon (e.g., 30 years), I compute the following:

* % of rolling years / sliding windows where US ends with a market cap at least 0.1% greater than when it started (this is how often US outperforms)

* % of rolling years / sliding windows where US ends with a market cap at least 0.1% lower than when it start (this is how often ex-US outperforms)

Note 1: if the market caps change by less than 0.1%, I consider that to be equal performance for both US and ex-US, as it's within measuring error from the reverse engineering on the market cap graph.

Note 2: if there aren't at least 10 rolling windows I can use to analyze the US/ex-US outperformance for a given time period and investment horizon, then I just skip that investment horizon, because there aren't enough samples to have statistically significant results.

Here's the raw data with all US market caps, as well as % of US/ex-US outperformance across various time periods and investment horizons: https://pastebin.com/MbYwvSk4.

Drawbacks of the analysis: I don't look at the magnitude of the outperformance. This is relative, and changes meaning with the investment horizon. So, e.g., it could theoretically be possible for US to outperform by 50% in 30% of the sliding windows, and ex-US to outperform by 1% in 70% of the sliding windows, my analysis would only capture the frequency (ex-US outperforms 70% of the time), but not the magnitude. I'm not yet sure how to properly address this.

I would like to call out a few particular things:

* US market cap before 1920 was very small, so US will vastly outperform ex-US for any time period that starts before 1920, regardless of the end date.

* US market cap from 1950 until 1970 was huge (consistently above 65%), so ex-US will vastly outperform US for any time period that starts between 1950-1970, regardless of the end date.

* If we look only at 1-year returns, US and ex-US outperform almost 50/50 across all years.

As a consequence of the points above:

* If we look at data from 1950 to 2020, and from 1970 to 2010, ex-US significantly outperforms US across all investment horizons.

* If we look at data from 1970 to 2020, US and ex-US are roughly equal on 1-5 and 20-25 year investment horizons, and ex-US vastly outperforms across other investment horizons.

* If we look at data from 1980 to 2010, US and ex-US are pretty much even across investment horizons.

* If we look at data from 1980 to 2020, and from 1985 to any end year, US outperforms ex-US across all investment horizons.

Both the start and end dates, as well as the investment horizon and the number of sliding window samples matter a lot when checking who outperforms more often. I hope this analysis will serve as a more convincing, data-driven argument in favor of international diversification for those who are boggled (pun intended) by the fact that US outperforms across all investment horizons for the data available on online portfolio backtesters like https://portfoliovisualizer.com.",264,0.94,111,Bogleheads,7/31/23 18:26,"edit: for those interested, i posted [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bogleheads/comments/15fog7m/how_the_us_manages_to_outperform_exus_not_part_2/), which looks at outperformance magnitudes as well :)

15fog7m,armadillo_antarillo,"How the US manages to outperform ex-US (not), part 2","My [previous post about how often US and ex-US outperformed throughout history](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/15eu4uf/how_the_us_manages_to_outperform_exus_not/) sparked a lot of interest and discussion. However, as I mentioned in my previous post, the main drawback of the analysis is that I only captured the frequency of outperformances, not the magnitudes.

Well, I sorted out the math, and here's part 2, with outperformance magnitudes included! TLDR, the relative US-to-ex-US performance ratio is: US^(growth) / ExUS^(growth) = US^(cap_%_end) * ExUS^(cap_%_start) / (US^(cap_%_start) * ExUS^(cap_%_end)). If there's interest, I'll post the formal proof in the comments.

Instead of reporting this ratio, I print a more helpful percentage for the US outperformance (100 * (US^(growth) / ExUS^(growth) - 1). Or, if US underperforms, instead of printing a negative percentage, I compute the ex-US outperformance with the same formula and print the ex-US outperformance magnitude instead.

In the data, you will see lines like this: ""US wins by 150%"", or ""ex-US wins by 200%"". What this means is that with a US-only portfolio, you'll end up having 150% more money than an ex-US-only portfolio (or 200% more with an ex-US-only portfolio compared to a US-only portfolio). This is agnostic of the actual cumulative returns, it only measures the relative magnitude of the US/ex-US outperformance.

For example, let's say ""US wins by 200%"", and you invest 100$. Let's say ex-US cumulative returns over that period are 70%, so an ex-US-only portfolio ends up with 170$. Then, a US-only portfolio would have 510$ (200% more money than ex-US). OTOH, if there is a downturn and ex-US has cumulative returns over that period of -70%, then ex-US-only portfolio ends up with 30$, and US-only ends up with 90$ (200% more money than ex-US). If ""US wins by 0%"", then that really means the two have identical returns.

Here's the complete data of US/ex-US outperformance magnitudes for all years, grouped by investment horizon; at the end, there's also aggregate data for various time periods (1900-2020, 1920-2020, 1950-2010, 1985-2020, etc.), which have the worst, median and best US performances: https://pastebin.com/j4CVTRWe.

Some VERY interesting results:

* If we look at short investment horizons (1-10 years), US and ex-US indeed take turns in outperforming each other, each cycle lasting about 1-2 decades.

* If we look at mid-term investment horizons (20-40 years), US ~exclusively outperforms if you start investing anytime between 1900 until ~1950, ex-US ~exclusively outperforms if you start investing anytime between 1950 until ~1985, and then again US ~exclusively outperforms if you start investing anytime after ~1985.

* If we look at very long-term investment horizons (60+ years), US and ex-US again take turns in outperforming each other, each cycle lasting about 1-2 decades.

* If we look at the past 100 years (1920-2020), up to investment horizons of 40 years, US and ex-US outperformances are roughly equal magnitudes, and at the median, US and ex-US portfolios are within 20% of each other; but for investment horizons of 45 to 55 years, ex-US beats US by > 50% more assets, even at the median; they go back to roughly equal for 60+ year investment horizons.

* OTOH, if we look at the past 120 years (1900-2020), US wins at the median across all investment horizons; for some, it's a small difference (0% to 20% more assets than ex-US), for others it's much larger (> 60% more assets). A little curious: for investment horizons of 50+ years, the absolute worst US performance yielded 3x less assets than ex-US, but the best US performance yielded 10x more assets than ex-US. This can likely be attributed to the insane growth of the US in the 1900-1920 period.

* If we look at the past 70 years (1950 until 2020), ex-US wins by a large margin across all investment horizons. This is because the US market cap reached an all-time-high of about 73% in the 50's and 60's, so any backtest that starts between 1950-1970 will yield ex-US a winner.

* If we look at the past 50 years (1970 until 2020), ex-US still turns out a winner across investment horizons, but by a small margin (median outperformance is within 0-20% for both).

* If we look at the past 40 years (1980 until 2020), US wins, but by a small margin (median outperformance is within 0-20%).

* If we look at the past 35 years (1985 until 2020), US wins across all investment horizons, and by a huge margin.

Some takeaways:

* If you started investing in the US before the end of WW2, well, you won the lottery!

* If you started investing in the US during the spectacular plateau of 1950-1970, when US market cap hovered between 65% and 73%, you were in really bad shape.

* If you started investing in the US about when the Japanese bubble started rising, you were in good shape.

* Curiously enough, market cap weighting of US and ex-US would have had quite poor results. You would have been severely underweight in the US during 1900-1920, overweight in the US during the 1950-1970 plateau, and overweight in ex-US during the Japanese bubble. If anything, investing using inverse market cap weights for US and ex-US would have yielded much better results in the long term.

Note: I played a little bit with portfoliovisualizer.com, and the data seems directionally correct, but magnitudes differ. I wonder if this is because the market cap performance analysis looks only at market price, and ignores dividends (assuming everyone reinvested their dividends, that would remove this problem, but that's not the case in real life). Not sure how big of an impact this would have. I also compared it with [this data from Blackrock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/financial-professionals/literature/investor-education/why-bother-with-international-stocks.pdf), in most years it's very close, in some there's a bigger difference, I guess it can also be explained by dividends and the fact that Blackrock uses EAFE rather than the whole world. In any case, it's directionally correct in all cases. I guess this is the best we can do with available data...

Edit: all of the backtests assume a single lump-sum investment either in a 100% US or a 100% ex-US portfolio. This is seldom the case in real-life, most of us make continuous contributions throughout our wealth-building phase, and we (should!) have both US and ex-US in our portfolios.

I think the most important takeaway is the importance of international diversification: we don't know if we are in an equivalent of pre-WW2 state, where investing in US-only would be a winning move for the next 30-40 years. We might be at the start of a 1950-1970 plateau, where US will continue to outperform for the next 1-2 decades, but would be a poor choice for the next 40 years. Or we might be just before another Japanese bubble. We don't know. **We can't know.**

The only thing we can do is to buy both the winner and the loser. It doesn't matter if it's a fixed asset allocation, 70/30, or 60/40, or 50/50, or market cap, or inverse market cap, we can know which AA is the best only in hindsight. But it's very important that we hold both the winner and the loser, because even the loser will grow in the long term, and it's better to turn out average than to risk going all-in on the loser.",149,0.93,55,Bogleheads,8/1/23 16:52,"my [previous post about how often us and ex-us outperformed throughout history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bogleheads/comments/15eu4uf/how_the_us_manages_to_outperform_exus_not/) sparked a lot of interest and discussion. however, as i mentioned in my previous post, the main drawback of the analysis is that i only captured the frequency of outperformances, not the magnitudes.

sgho3n,arash_param,Lessons from Buffet: Never Lose Money,"Hey friends and fellow investors,

I am an avid reader and one of the best investing ideas I have recently learned about is the difference between arithmetic and geometric returns and how that leads to wealth creation. Thought I would share my learnings with you guys for your feedback and thoughts.

*----*

*“The first rule of investing is never lose money” – Warren Buffet*

Interest in investing seems to be at an all-time high right now. People of all ages and wealth statuses are looking to invest in numerous asset classes across both public and private markets.

This is wonderful. More people interested in investing should hopefully result in more people achieving financial security.

To achieve that goal, investors need to leverage the most powerful force available to them, compounding. However, most people focus on arithmetic returns when making investment decisions, which puts the goal at risk. Analyzing investments based on arithmetic returns creates a higher chance of losing money. What successful investors do is evaluate investment opportunities through the lens of geometric returns.

That is exactly what we will dive into in this essay: What are geometric and arithmetic returns? Why does focusing on geometric returns lead to better decision-making? How can you use this concept to make smarter bets?

# Having The Right Perspective

When evaluating investments, we can adopt either an arithmetic or a geometric view. The perspective we choose will determine which opportunities we pursue.

An arithmetic return is the average we are all familiar with. It is the sum of a series of returns, divided by the total amount of series. This is the simple average most people are familiar with and the most common way to evaluate opportunities.

&#x200B;

Geometric averages are calculated differently. Multiply all the returns (plus 1) and raise it to the inverse of the length of the series.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a6awoms9tve81.png?width=415&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb87b08f116e80c99ab1889eef8166446c8069f

Understanding the formulas is not important. What is essential is to remember that we should examine investment returns through a geometric lens ***because doing so accounts for compounding.***

Why am I placing such emphasis on compounding?

Investing is a process that happens sequentially through time. It does not occur in just one interval of time, or the aggregate of many intervals of time. This means that returns are an iterative process; returns compound. In each period ***we invest what we are left with*** from the last period. Thus, the starting size of our capital base will determine how large our compound interest will be.

This is the principle that fundamentally determines the nature of investing and the way we need to interpret returns. Looking at geometric returns is how we capture this principle in metrics.

As critical as this concept is, the difference between these two metrics is not intuitive. To make it more tangible, let’s look at a gambling example.

# Playing Dice

Imagine you are at a casino table with a big stack of cash in front of you—your entire life savings of $100. You are going to play a game of dice.

The rules are as follows:

* If you roll a 1, you lose 50% of your entire savings
* If you roll a 2, 3, 4, or 5, you make 5% of your entire savings
* If you roll a 6, you make 50% of your entire savings
* You can play as many times as you want

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mocg6ratve81.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=769c1b3f42708cd610933568972499346f18292f

Would you play?

The proposition sounds like a symmetrical bet with an obvious edge from the extra 5% you should get 2/3rds of the time. The expected arithmetic return is 3.3%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ceapiihbtve81.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&s=43f899127fbca7805111fabc9174f271c3a85dba

Now, you might have some hesitation if you were allowed to play the game once and you rolled a 1. Playing once exposes you to being unlucky and having your wealth cut in half. Playing numerous times should remove luck from the equation and result in an average expected return of 3.3%. So, you decide to play.

What would your outcome be?

Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the table below shows your chances of ending up in different wealth buckets assuming you play the game 300 times.

Playing this game results in a \~50% chance of ending up with less than $1 and a \~80% chance of having less than your initial $100. Yet, the arithmetic expected return is 3.3%.

What gives?

The culprit is how arithmetic averages are calculated.

The simulation resulted in many outcomes with low ending wealth values but a few outcomes with incredibly high ending wealth values. The high but unlikely outcomes are ***so good that they lift up the arithmetic average***.

Here’s another way of thinking about this: If Bill Gates walks into a bar with nine people, on average there will be 10 billionaires at the bar.

This should highlight the difference between the ***most likely outcome*** and the ***average outcome***. As investors, we should focus on the most likely outcome to avoid the arithmetic trap. This is where geometric returns come in.

When we consider the geometric average, it is clear that this is a bad bet. We lose -1.5% of our wealth per roll. Compounded over 300 rolls, we are essentially left with nothing.

# Math Or Magic?

Based on the above, we might assume that never playing this game is the right answer.

However, that isn’t quite true. When you focus on increasing geometric returns, magical things start to happen.

Let’s keep the same game but add one additional rule: You can choose to bet as much of your wealth as you want.

Based on this new rule, you now bet 40% of your capital base on each roll instead of going all-in. You keep the remaining 60% on the sideline earning nothing.

By betting less of your wealth, your arithmetic average falls predictably by 60%—from 3.3% to 1.3%. But before you get disappointed, remember that geometric average is what really counts. When we park money on the sideline, our geometric average increases to 2.1%.

When you play 300 times, you end up making money in \~82% of the outcomes, with an expected ending wealth of \~$700, an increase of \~7x your starting wealth.

Pause there for a second and let that simmer.

We lowered our risk profile by parking 60% of our net worth out of the bet ***and*** increased our return.

Doesn’t that go violate the risk & return tradeoff—a core pillar of traditional finance? How did we get a higher geometric return by betting less? Is this math or magic?

The answer involves the relationship between two competing forces: (1) the edge of a specific investment or bet and (2) a concept called Negative Geometric Drag (NGD). \[1\]

The edge of an investment or bet is the mathematical advantage you have. Sticking to the example above, our edge is the 3.3% arithmetic advantage.

NGD is the drag on your return caused by gaining and then losing the same proportion of your wealth. It is based on the principle that ***a loss*** ***disproportionally*** ***hurts you*** because it reduces your capital base for the next investment opportunity. For example, if you have $100 and you lose 50%, your ending wealth is $50. To grow your wealth back to $100, you need more than a 50% return; you need a 100% return since your starting wealth is now $50.

You can think of the relationship between the edge and the NGD as a seesaw.

When you bet a lower percentage of your total wealth, the edge is the more powerful force and the NGD is negligible. However, as the portion of the investment size as a percentage of your total wealth increases, the NGD becomes the more powerful force and the impact of a loss hurts you more than the edge. \[2\] This is because the edge of an investment grows linearly to the amount invested but, NGD grows exponentially. \[3\]

# Protect Your Capital

In all the situations described above, we had certainty over probabilities and outcomes. The real world is not as precise. But there are still useful principles and heuristics we can extract.

The most important is to focus on geometric returns and compounding.

Remember, when we invest, the capital base we start with is the ending capital base from the last period. The capital base is the very thing returns are built on. This means a large loss disproportionately lowers our geometric return because it leaves us with a much lower capital base to reinvest and compound on our next wager.

More tactically, this means taking steps to preserve your capital base. \[4\] This doesn’t mean avoiding risky bets; rather it requires you to understand how to size your position in risky bets, so your edge is greater than the NGD.

With that, I will leave you with Buffet’s second rule of investing: “*Never forget rule number 1.*”

i am an avid reader and one of the best investing ideas i have recently learned about is the difference between arithmetic and geometric returns and how that leads to wealth creation. thought i would share my learnings with you guys for your feedback and thoughts.

*“the first rule of investing is never lose money” – warren buffet*

interest in investing seems to be at an all-time high right now. people of all ages and wealth statuses are looking to invest in numerous asset classes across both public and private markets.

this is wonderful. more people interested in investing should hopefully result in more people achieving financial security.

to achieve that goal, investors need to leverage the most powerful force available to them, compounding. however, most people focus on arithmetic returns when making investment decisions, which puts the goal at risk. analyzing investments based on arithmetic returns creates a higher chance of losing money. what successful investors do is evaluate investment opportunities through the lens of geometric returns.

that is exactly what we will dive into in this essay: what are geometric and arithmetic returns? why does focusing on geometric returns lead to better decision-making? how can you use this concept to make smarter bets?

# having the right perspective

when evaluating investments, we can adopt either an arithmetic or a geometric view. the perspective we choose will determine which opportunities we pursue.

an arithmetic return is the average we are all familiar with. it is the sum of a series of returns, divided by the total amount of series. this is the simple average most people are familiar with and the most common way to evaluate opportunities.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/7gsvepu8tve81.png?width=231&format=png&auto=webp&s=84afd8c255d513809f88d5bc73782cb5df0f5fcf

geometric averages are calculated differently. multiply all the returns (plus 1) and raise it to the inverse of the length of the series.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/a6awoms9tve81.png?width=415&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb87b08f116e80c99ab1889eef8166446c8069f

understanding the formulas is not important. what is essential is to remember that we should examine investment returns through a geometric lens ***because doing so accounts for compounding.***

why am i placing such emphasis on compounding?

investing is a process that happens sequentially through time. it does not occur in just one interval of time, or the aggregate of many intervals of time. this means that returns are an iterative process; returns compound. in each period ***we invest what we are left with*** from the last period. thus, the starting size of our capital base will determine how large our compound interest will be.

this is the principle that fundamentally determines the nature of investing and the way we need to interpret returns. looking at geometric returns is how we capture this principle in metrics.

as critical as this concept is, the difference between these two metrics is not intuitive. to make it more tangible, let’s look at a gambling example.

# playing dice

imagine you are at a casino table with a big stack of cash in front of you—your entire life savings of $100. you are going to play a game of dice.

the rules are as follows:

* if you roll a 1, you lose 50% of your entire savings
* if you roll a 2, 3, 4, or 5, you make 5% of your entire savings
* if you roll a 6, you make 50% of your entire savings
* you can play as many times as you want

&#x200b;

would you play?

the proposition sounds like a symmetrical bet with an obvious edge from the extra 5% you should get 2/3rds of the time. the expected arithmetic return is 3.3%.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/ceapiihbtve81.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&s=43f899127fbca7805111fabc9174f271c3a85dba

now, you might have some hesitation if you were allowed to play the game once and you rolled a 1. playing once exposes you to being unlucky and having your wealth cut in half. playing numerous times should remove luck from the equation and result in an average expected return of 3.3%. so, you decide to play.

what would your outcome be?

1) For one thing - the demography. In this country it is just terrible, populations are not growing. The population that's here is aging rapidly. Fertility rates are very low. I think we are going to have a perpetual labor shortage. Politically we find immigration a very hard thing to accept. I think there are going to be pressures on labor costs in the future. That will prove to be inflationary. 
2) I also think that the current political climate where we would like to disassociate ourselves from China, where we're going to try to balkanize supply chains. Trade that has been a big inflation reducer in the past, will be less important in the future. And I think as we move much more to ""America first""  and we want to do everything we can in the United States, this is likely to be inflationary. 
3) And third. We seem to have intractable budget deficits. And we have enormous amounts of government debt relative to our GDP and relative to the size of our economy. And I think we will get rid of that debt the way countries have gotten rid of debt throughout history, namely by inflating it away, 
So if i'm right, there's at least a strong possibility. And it won't be easy to get back to the two percent inflation target. And we'd be very lucky if we got down from five to four to three, but then we're going to have significant inflation and therefore I would like to have people invested in things that are traditionally good inflation edges.

p1uuog,apollosmith,I did the HSA math. This is a no-brainer!,"I've never really considered an Health Savings Account because I was scared by the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) requirement. After doing the math, I've realize how wrong I was! In short, if you can save a couple hundred dollars per month, an HSA is possibly your best investment vehicle (after an employer-matched 401K). Here are the calculations to consider...

#1 - Determine your tax savings. Find your tax bracket at https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets HSA contributions are pre-tax, so reduce your taxable income. I'm in the 22% bracket, so my tax saving is 22% on contributions. My state tax saving is an additional 5% (yours will vary based on state). Let's say I can contribute $300/month or $3600 year. My 27% tax savings would be $972/year.

#2 - Determine your insurance premium savings. You'll need to consult your employer or health insurance provider. I work for a state education institution. My current family ""wellness"" plan is $174/month and the HDHP plan is $46/month - so a savings of $128/month or $1536/year.

#3 - Consider how much MORE you might pay in health care expenses with the HDHP. This is the part that always scared me away, but it turns out it's nearly impossible to pay more than I would save.

If I have $0 in health care costs, switching to a HDHP and putting $300/month in an HSA would save me $2508/year ($972 tax savings + $1536 premiums savings).

My current plan has a $1500/family deductible (then 30%), whereas the HDHP has a $3000/family deductible (then 20%). If I had $3000 in expenses (doctor visits and one minor surgery or a couple ER visits per year, etc. - fairly typical for me), the savings would be around $1508/year ($2508 savings - ~$1000 difference in expenses).

Let's say things go REALLY bad - like a serious accident, cancer, etc. My current plan max is $8000 and the HDHP max is $10000. In this worst-case scenario I still save $508 ($2508-$2000 max difference).

The only way I could lose money on an HSA is to contribute <$140/month AND hit my $10K max out-of-pocket every year.

So, $140+/month in an HSA is already a no-lose scenario for me, but that doesn't consider the additional value of the tax-free HSA gains over time. This is best realized by never using HSA funds to pay medical expenses (unless you have to or until you want to). $300/month at a 7% annual return for 20 years returns $156,278 on $72,000 in contributions. Maxing out at $600/month returns $312,556 on $86,400 in contributions. THESE GAINS ARE 100% TAX FREE! You never pay taxes on HSA contributions, gains, or withdrawals (thus the triple-tax advantage)!

Now, the HSA funds must be spent on health care expenses (or pay a 20% penalty). A couple can expect $300K+ in retirement health expenses. However, you can reimburse yourself for expenses incurred any time while on the plan - save your receipts for 20 years and then pay yourself. After age 65, you can apply them to long-term care expenses. Or you can use them on whatever you want by simply paying taxes on the withdrawals - making the HSA no different than a Traditional IRA.

Is there anything I'm overlooking? Is the HSA really a no-brainer?",285,0.98,211,Bogleheads,8/10/21 14:11,"i've never really considered an health savings account because i was scared by the high deductible health plan (hdhp) requirement. after doing the math, i've realize how wrong i was! in short, if you can save a couple hundred dollars per month, an hsa is possibly your best investment vehicle (after an employer-matched 401k). here are the calculations to consider...

#1 - determine your tax savings. find your tax bracket at https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets hsa contributions are pre-tax, so reduce your taxable income. i'm in the 22% bracket, so my tax saving is 22% on contributions. my state tax saving is an additional 5% (yours will vary based on state). let's say i can contribute $300/month or $3600 year. my 27% tax savings would be $972/year.

#2 - determine your insurance premium savings. you'll need to consult your employer or health insurance provider. i work for a state education institution. my current family ""wellness"" plan is $174/month and the hdhp plan is $46/month - so a savings of $128/month or $1536/year.

#3 - consider how much more you might pay in health care expenses with the hdhp. this is the part that always scared me away, but it turns out it's nearly impossible to pay more than i would save.

if i have $0 in health care costs, switching to a hdhp and putting $300/month in an hsa would save me $2508/year ($972 tax savings + $1536 premiums savings).

my current plan has a $1500/family deductible (then 30%), whereas the hdhp has a $3000/family deductible (then 20%). if i had $3000 in expenses (doctor visits and one minor surgery or a couple er visits per year, etc. - fairly typical for me), the savings would be around $1508/year ($2508 savings - ~$1000 difference in expenses).

let's say things go really bad - like a serious accident, cancer, etc. my current plan max is $8000 and the hdhp max is $10000. in this worst-case scenario i still save $508 ($2508-$2000 max difference).

Just before I turned 24 I finally got a solid-enough full time job to move to Brooklyn with my friends. Our place was on the border between Clinton Hill and Bed-Stuy and I remember walking down the leafy streets lined with brownstones and townhomes and thinking: “for me, that’s making it.” I’d grown up middle-class in the suburbs but always idolized the city, and in those stately old buildings I saw the sort of future that only seemed possible if I won the lottery, achieved some financial station by randomness and luck rather than knowledge.

In an earnest effort to help me learn about finances, my mom - who is extremely financially cautious, and who never invested in anything riskier than certificates of deposit - set me up with a financial advisor at Ameriprise. He was a nice-enough older guy who arranged quarterly meetings with me at his office in midtown Manhattan. I had virtually nothing to invest, but understood what a Roth IRA was from Reddit and made sure to max it out monthly from my paltry paycheck. My mom also wrote me an annual check which I handed off to this guy to invest in whatever he thought he should. He also convinced me - a healthy, then-24 year old with no dependents, to buy life insurance. Knowing nothing, it seemed to make sense to me at the time.

At the end of that year, my father died of cancer. He was not a rich man, but he had a $1m life insurance policy which he divided five ways in his will across his four kids and widow. I walked away with $200k, more money than I’d ever imagined coming into. It was about five years income, so I knew that while I couldn’t live off of it forever, it was also the biggest windfall I’d ever - and likely will ever - see in my life.

I had no idea what I was doing. I was terrified and sure I would blow it somehow. Yet I knew I had to start learning. Perhaps it was an inkling that my financial advisor was a charlatan, or maybe it was the inherent insecurity of outsourcing your understanding of your own finances to someone whose job security is only as strong as your distrust of your own financial understanding, but I felt like I needed to get my own bearings. I asked my uncle - my father’s brother, the only member of my family who seems to have financial knowledge - for advice. And he, very simply, told me to read “The Little Book of Common Sense Investing”, one of the books that changed my life.

I read it on my phone after work, sometimes on the train to see my therapist and untangle my feelings of grief. And as I read it, I found my fear begin to dissipate. Bogle, in his simplifying, sensible, calming way, defined the ways people screwed themselves financially: by trying to beat and predict the market, trading a lot and getting hosed on fees and taxes, and, hitting close to home, shelling out to financial advisors who do all of the former and eat your margins to line their own pockets. He showed me that the whole financial services industry is predicated on the lie that some investor somewhere knows where the market is going, and that there is any better outcome than claiming your fair share of the market’s returns. 

He made sure to carve a little room for fun, too. Put the preponderance of your cash in index funds, but set aside some for other investments you’re interested in. He put me at ease and helped me see how, in the wake of my father’s death, that the rest of my life needn’t crumble behind it.

So I went to the Ameriprise advisor and fired him. I pressed him on why he encouraged me to take life insurance; he wouldn’t cop to it, but I knew he made a commission. I transferred my cash over to Vanguard and, by 2015, invested it. 95% into index funds, 5% on a risky company called Tesla and another one called SolarCity. I kept maxing that IRA. In 2017, seeing some friends in tech begin building stuff in crypto, I began DCA there too.

In the intervening years, the simple peace of mind Bogle gave me, and the gift my uncle gave me by recommending him, drove my light evangelism for the investing philosophy. I bought copies for all my siblings and for some coworkers. If a friend ever came into money or an inheritance; I hipped them to it. I wanted to help others feel the steady, sensibility that I did.

But then the market began going crazy. By 2021, I was a millionaire. Looking across my tiny apartment at my wife early that year, the thought occurred to me. Could we buy a townhome? In Brooklyn?

Today, I am renovating the home of my dreams. A place I never thought I could achieve without fate intervening to enrich me. But fate did intervene; It tragically took my father from me. There is nothing I wouldn’t trade to have him back. But I can’t have him back, I can only honor the final gift he gave me to build wealth that I will someday, hopefully pass on to future generations. And I cannot rely on fate for that. I can only rely on myself.

I am so grateful to my dad. I am so grateful to my uncle, for giving me the tools to edify myself. And I am so grateful to Jack Bogle, whose advice helped me emerge from my fear and grief to building a new home of my own.

I don’t think of my story as being about riches or property, but rather as a metaphor for meeting adversity. Because of the voices, alive and dead, that encouraged me not to fear the future but rather to understand it, I was able to seize the means to build one I wanted to live in, and live for. Wealth, to me, is not any particular sum of money, but rather the habits and knowledge that allow an individual to protect and grow it. Above everything, I want to give thanks for that knowledge, which helped me emerge from unthinkable sadness into a future I never imagined I might inhabit.",217,0.92,15,Bogleheads,8/28/23 1:10,"as the title says, i want to say thank you. i don’t know why i decided to create an anonymous account for this. i just wanted to tell my story and thank you.

so i went to the ameriprise advisor and fired him. i pressed him on why he encouraged me to take life insurance; he wouldn’t cop to it, but i knew he made a commission. i transferred my cash over to vanguard and, by 2015, invested it. 95% into index funds, 5% on a risky company called tesla and another one called solarcity. i kept maxing that ira. in 2017, seeing some friends in tech begin building stuff in crypto, i began dca there too.

in the intervening years, the simple peace of mind bogle gave me, and the gift my uncle gave me by recommending him, drove my light evangelism for the investing philosophy. i bought copies for all my siblings and for some coworkers. if a friend ever came into money or an inheritance; i hipped them to it. i wanted to help others feel the steady, sensibility that i did.

but then the market began going crazy. by 2021, i was a millionaire. looking across my tiny apartment at my wife early that year, the thought occurred to me. could we buy a townhome? in brooklyn?

today, i am renovating the home of my dreams. a place i never thought i could achieve without fate intervening to enrich me. but fate did intervene; it tragically took my father from me. there is nothing i wouldn’t trade to have him back. but i can’t have him back, i can only honor the final gift he gave me to build wealth that i will someday, hopefully pass on to future generations. and i cannot rely on fate for that. i can only rely on myself.

i am so grateful to my dad. i am so grateful to my uncle, for giving me the tools to edify myself. and i am so grateful to jack bogle, whose advice helped me emerge from my fear and grief to building a new home of my own.

i don’t think of my story as being about riches or property, but rather as a metaphor for meeting adversity. because of the voices, alive and dead, that encouraged me not to fear the future but rather to understand it, i was able to seize the means to build one i wanted to live in, and live for. wealth, to me, is not any particular sum of money, but rather the habits and knowledge that allow an individual to protect and grow it. above everything, i want to give thanks for that knowledge, which helped me emerge from unthinkable sadness into a future i never imagined i might inhabit."

plmm6j,Your_Username1234321,Mathematically calculating whether your time is worth VTI/VXUS vs VTWAX,"(TL:DR at the bottom)

There has been a little debate here lately on whether the time spent using VTI/VXUS to buy the whole world market is worth it when you could save yourself a lot of time and trouble by just using VTWAX and be done with it. I did a little math here to help people decide for themselves. I’m comparing VTI/VXUS against VTWAX (and not VT), because if your goal is truly is to do as little work as possible and forget about a few measly basis points, VTWAX represents keeping it simple in its purest form. If you can set up an auto deposit every month, you have literally zero work to do with VTWAX.

However, if you want to do a little more work every month, the performance of VTWAX can be replicated exactly by looking up VTWAX’s portfolio every month and seeing how much of their equities are US based vs. foreign based and buying the ETFs (VTI/VXUS) in the same proportions. (For the record, once you understand how to do all this, it should take you less than 15 minutes per month--it takes me closer to 10.)

The question I'm trying to answer is this: **Is that 15 minutes worth it?**

I’m trying to keep the math as simple as possible without it being so simplistic that it’s meaningless. I have left out a lot of details (taxes on dividends, foreign tax credits, retirement accountants vs brokerages, ect.). If there is a consensus in the comments that suggests that my parameters are way off or if you think I’ve left out parameters that would SIGNIFICANTLY skew the results one way or the other, I’ll try to redo the math.

**Parameters:**

Your Initial Investment: $3000

Your monthly contributions: $500

Years you plan to invest: 30 years

VTWAX’s expense ratio: 0.1%

VTI’s expense ratio:  0.03%

VXUS’s expense ratio: 0.1%

Total expense ratio when you average 58% VTI and 42% VXUS: 0.051%

Ballpark Annual expected return on VTWAX: 7%

Ballpark Annual expected return on VTI/VXUS split: 7.051%

Minutes it takes you to invest in VTWAX every month: 0

Minutes it takes you to invest in VTI/VXUS every month: 15

&#x200B;

Using the simple Future Value function in Google sheets, the final balance of each account **after 30 years** are as follows:

**VTWAX: $634,334.99**

**VTI/VXUS: $640,753.06**

Over 30 years, those measly 5 basis points have earned you an additional $6,547.19. Now, here comes the important question: was that extra 15 minute you spent every month to earn that $6,547.19 worth it?

Over the course of those 30 years, those 15 minute chucks mean that you spent 90 hours working to earn $6,418.07. And that comes out to an hourly rate of $72.75.

**TL:DR:** According to my very, very rough calculations, if you chose to spend 15 minutes every month looking up VT’s portfolio balance and then buying the ETFs in those proportions instead using VTWAX, you are basically choosing to take a job that will take you 90 hours to finish and will pay you $72.75 per hour.

I’m willing to take that job. Therefore, I’m taking the VTI/VXUS route.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

A couple people have wanted to take into account inflation. You can do one of two things here:

1. You can optimistically assume that the 7% return I have here factors in inflation in which case the math is correct already. I'm skeptical, I really hope you are correct and we can expect 9% returns indefinitely.
2. You can assume that the 7% return I'm estimating did not take into account inflation. If you would like to assume a 5% return (7%-a 2% inflation rate), than the final balances are VTWAX: $429,532.55, VTI/VXUS:$433,684.67. In this case, the hourly rate of your work in today's dollars is $46.13. So basically, imagine you will be making $46 per hour this year and you will be getting a 2% raise on that rate every year to compensate for inflation.",138,0.94,58,Bogleheads,9/10/21 10:52,"(tl:dr at the bottom)

>**Jack Bogle. That was one of the questions that our community board had asked us to ask you about was that meeting you had with him I believe in 2017. Can you talk about that meeting? Did it change any of your views on investing?**  
>  
>Well, it changed a lot about investing for me. I loved the fact that he was going to give me an hour in his office. He gave me an hour and a half. I'd heard he is a little bit on the gruff side, if he wants to be. He was as gentle and as nice as he could be with the exception of about 30 seconds. What I found was I always thought of Vanguard and John Bogle as being my competition, because they were preaching a different story and advocating a different combination of asset classes. I had a hard time understanding what part of the academic research did John Bogle not understand? He was very open to talk about it.  
>  
>It turned out Vanguard was not our competition. We were in a totally different part of the world in terms of the investors that we were serving. But from their world, they wanted everything to be as simple as possible, they wanted it to be as acceptable as possible. For example, if we have a portfolio that is partly small and partly large in value, in growth, etc, and the S&P 500 is doing great and these other asset classes aren't, we have prepared our clients that that is the way it goes. This is the other side of the coin when you have broad diversification.  
>  
>He says, ""Our clients can't take that. We need clients who are satisfied with being,"" for example, he was always an S&P 500 guy. When we first started having him on the radio, he didn't want any international in the portfolio. He just wanted the S&P 500. Later, gently he starts to add a little international, but he almost always he would say, ""But no more than 20%, because you just don't need it."" He also started advocating for the total market index, which has virtually the same return as the S&P 500 for the last 90-some years.  
>  
>So it wasn't a big change. It was still a cap weighted, but it means it's cap weighted in companies that the people who are investing at Vanguard know and love probably. So when they're down, like from 2000 through 2009 when the S&P 500 not only twice loses half of the value of its portfolio, but the compound rate of return is less than 1% to negative 1% a year for that 10-year period. If that had been small cap value at a negative 1% and the S&P 500 compounding at 7 or 8% like our accounts did, and if you were around back then, your accounts would have likely have done. We would have been gone. We would have been the devil incarnate, because we had those things and went down. But when it was the S&P 500 that went down, people said, ""It's okay. They're great companies. They're here to last. It is simpler and more dependable.""  
>  
>That's what Vanguard wanted for people. He knew DFA. He knew all about DFA. He was a great fan of Fama and French. He approved of what the wrote, but he said, ""That doesn't mean it's right for our investors,"" which, by the way, goes over into the target date funds. It's the same thing.

Below is an overview of taxable accounts: when to use one, how investments are taxed, and tax-minimization strategies/tips. It's specific to US investors / tax laws, though some of the general themes might be broadly applicable to other locales.

I hope it's useful to folks less familiar with investing in taxable accounts, as well as those with more experience who haven't gone down the rabbit-hole of tax-minimization techniques.

## When to invest in a taxable account

Investing in a taxable account is the final step in the /r/personalfinance ""how to handle money"" [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) / [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png). Before that comes saving an emergency fund, paying down high-interest debt, saving for near-term goals, and maxing your tax-advantaged investment/savings options including:

* Any employer retirement account or pension available to you - e.g. a [401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)), [403(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/403(b)), [457(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/457(b)), [SIMPLE IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/SIMPLE_IRA), or [SEP IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/SEP)
   * [Mega-backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Mega-backdoor_Roth) contributions to your 401(k) or Roth IRA if supported by your employer's 401(k) plan
* Your [HSA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) if available
* Your [IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/IRA) / [Roth IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Roth_IRA) if you have reported earned income (use [backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth) procedure if over the income limit for direct contributions)
* If saving for future education expenses, a [529 plan](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/529_plan)
* Savings bonds: [I bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/I_savings_bonds) or [EE bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/EE_savings_bonds) provide state tax exemption & federal tax deferral (or exemption if used for qualified education expenses, including funding a 529 plan)
    * No need to max these, but consider gradually transitioning your emergency fund to I bonds (mindful of the 1 year lockup), and/or using these savings bonds for a portion of your bond allocation

Note: the order above isn't  precisely prioritized/prescriptive; the recommended prioritization if all account types are available is: employer plan contributions to max any match, then HSA, then IRA / Roth IRA, then employer plan contributions up to limit, then 529.

Whatever you do, don't be like the [roughly half of Robinhood users](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/brokerage-reviews/robinhood-review/) investing for the first time in a taxable account, using a brokerage that doesn't even support IRAs.

## Taxation of taxable account investments

Income & gains from investments in a taxable account are taxed as they are realized, with the tax rates depending on various attributes of the investment & your income / filing status.

In general, you'll pay taxes on any:

1.	Dividends (treatment / rate dependent on on issuer & holding period; effective rate dependent on any foreign tax credit)
2.	Realized capital gains on selling (treatment / rate dependent on holding period)
3.	Capital gains distributions from mutual funds (treatment / rate dependent on underlying holding period within fund)
4.	Interest (taxed as ordinary income unless exempt due to issuer -- e.g. Treasury bond interest is exempt from state/local income tax, while municipal bond interest is exempt from federal income tax, and often state/local income tax in state of issue)

For stock ETFs or Vanguard stock index mutual funds with an ETF share class, only (1) or (2) apply -- (3) shouldn't apply for those types of Vanguard mutual funds because they [siphon out](https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985) capital gains via their ETF share class in creation/redemption trades.

**Treatments**

You'll be taxed at long-term capital gains rates on:

* qualified dividends (dividends from a qualified issuer/holding held for at least 61 days)
* capital gains on holdings sold after being held for more than a year
* long-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund

You'll be taxed at ordinary income rates on the remainder:

* non-qualified dividends (non-qualified issuer or holding period)
* short-term gains (sold when held for a year or less)
* short-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund
* non-exempt bond interest

**Rates**

Tax rates by income bracket & filing status may be found [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Qualified_dividend#Tax_rates). Note that the income thresholds are effectively higher / shifted due to the [standard deduction](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/standard-deduction). The long-term capital gains rates are applied by considering the long-term gains income as being stacked on top of ordinary income (including short-term gains).

[This calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) may be helpful in estimating your federal & state tax burden for a given gain.

There's no automatic withholding of taxes on any of this taxable investment income (realized/distributed gains, dividends, interest). You may need to make quarterly estimated tax payments around the end of the quarter with this income, or increase any salary/paycheck withholding by submitting a new form W-4 to your employer, in order to avoid underpayment penalties later for not meeting the minimum payment or safe-harbor thresholds.

## Minimizing taxes

Below is only a partial list of tax-minimization strategies with only a brief description of each; more-complete lists & details may be found in the wiki under [Tax basics](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_basics#Taxable_accounts) and [Taxable account investing strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Taxable_account#Taxable_account_investing_strategy).

* [Rebalancing with contributions](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Rebalancing#Different_rebalancing_approaches) \- Try to rebalance to your target allocation using new money as much as possible to reduce tax implications around selling to rebalance. Turning off dividend reinvestment can help with this; direct dividends along with new money to funds below their target allocation.
* [Tax-efficient fund placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) \- E.g. try to keep non-municipal bond funds in a tax-advantaged account when possible, but ideally don't overweight them too much in a Roth account to avoid opportunity cost around higher tax-free compounded growth.
* [Specific identification of shares](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Specific_identification_of_shares) \- Ensure your brokerage account is configured so that when selling, you can select specific lots based on whether they individually have gains or losses, and their holding period.
* [Tax-loss harvesting](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting) \- Have an itch to 'do something' when market prices drop? Consider tax-loss harvesting your recent lots, selling and immediately replacing them with roughly equivalent but not [substantially identical](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale#Substantially_identical) funds (i.e. not the same fund, or another share class in the same fund like VTI/VTSAX, but another low-cost index fund tracking the same asset class).
    * Note that this trades a tax break now for a higher potential tax burden in the future (because you lowered your cost basis). If your current long-term capital gains tax rate is lower than you expect it to be in the future, it may be unwise to harvest losses unless they would offset any short-term realized gains for the year (i.e. only harvest short-term losses if you have short-term realized gains, and only harvest long-term losses if you have only short-term realized gains).
    * You need to be mindful of [wash sale](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale) rules (avoid purchasing the sold security / a substantially identical fund within 30 days before or after the sale, in any account including tax-advantaged ones).
* [Tax-gain harvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/s69z9i/psa_taxgain_harvesting_may_reduce_your_future_tax/) \- Does your income this year & filing status qualify you for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate? Take advantage of that by realizing gains while they're ""free"" (\* caveats may apply).
* Hold separate US vs international ETFs/funds in taxable -- 3 of the [benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sxtt66/explanation_on_difference/hxu32xg/?context=3) of doing that are specific to taxable accounts, including opportunity to & ease of applying the 2 preceding strategies, and ability to reliably claim the foreign tax credit. Holding VT/VTWAX in taxable? Consider tax-loss harvesting lots with losses into VTI + VXUS, or if you're in a situation where tax-gain harvesting seems beneficial, consider tax-gain harvesting lots with long-term gains.
    * Note that if you're in that latter situation where tax-gain harvesting seems beneficial, it may be a bad trade to do tax-loss harvesting unless you’ll have only short-term realized gains for the year, since offsetting long-term gains now isn't beneficial, and the higher gains in the future due to a lowered cost basis may be taxed at a higher rate.
* Favor funds without capital gains distributions (i.e. ETFs or Vanguard mutual funds with an ETF share class, if the latter are available without transaction fees), and different funds than in your tax-advantaged accounts to help avoid [wash sales](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Wash_sale) & ease tax-loss harvesting.",397,1,85,Bogleheads,3/7/22 13:23,"## [taxable account](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/taxable_account) - bogleheads wiki

below is an overview of taxable accounts: when to use one, how investments are taxed, and tax-minimization strategies/tips. it's specific to us investors / tax laws, though some of the general themes might be broadly applicable to other locales.

i hope it's useful to folks less familiar with investing in taxable accounts, as well as those with more experience who haven't gone down the rabbit-hole of tax-minimization techniques.

## when to invest in a taxable account

investing in a taxable account is the final step in the /r/personalfinance ""how to handle money"" [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) / [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lsouqr2.png). before that comes saving an emergency fund, paying down high-interest debt, saving for near-term goals, and maxing your tax-advantaged investment/savings options including:

* any employer retirement account or pension available to you - e.g. a [401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)), [403(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/403(b)), [457(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/457(b)), [simple ira](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/simple_ira), or [sep ira](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/sep)
   * [mega-backdoor roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/mega-backdoor_roth) contributions to your 401(k) or roth ira if supported by your employer's 401(k) plan
* your [hsa](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/health_savings_account) if available
* your [ira](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/ira) / [roth ira](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/roth_ira) if you have reported earned income (use [backdoor roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/backdoor_roth) procedure if over the income limit for direct contributions)
* if saving for future education expenses, a [529 plan](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/529_plan)
* savings bonds: [i bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/i_savings_bonds) or [ee bonds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/ee_savings_bonds) provide state tax exemption & federal tax deferral (or exemption if used for qualified education expenses, including funding a 529 plan)
    * no need to max these, but consider gradually transitioning your emergency fund to i bonds (mindful of the 1 year lockup), and/or using these savings bonds for a portion of your bond allocation

note: the order above isn't  precisely prioritized/prescriptive; the recommended prioritization if all account types are available is: employer plan contributions to max any match, then hsa, then ira / roth ira, then employer plan contributions up to limit, then 529.

whatever you do, don't be like the [roughly half of robinhood users](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/brokerage-reviews/robinhood-review/) investing for the first time in a taxable account, using a brokerage that doesn't even support iras.

## taxation of taxable account investments

income & gains from investments in a taxable account are taxed as they are realized, with the tax rates depending on various attributes of the investment & your income / filing status.

in general, you'll pay taxes on any:

1.	dividends (treatment / rate dependent on on issuer & holding period; effective rate dependent on any foreign tax credit)
2.	realized capital gains on selling (treatment / rate dependent on holding period)
3.	capital gains distributions from mutual funds (treatment / rate dependent on underlying holding period within fund)
4.	interest (taxed as ordinary income unless exempt due to issuer -- e.g. treasury bond interest is exempt from state/local income tax, while municipal bond interest is exempt from federal income tax, and often state/local income tax in state of issue)

for stock etfs or vanguard stock index mutual funds with an etf share class, only (1) or (2) apply -- (3) shouldn't apply for those types of vanguard mutual funds because they [siphon out](https://www.investopedia.com/how-vanguard-patented-a-system-to-avoid-taxes-in-mutual-funds-4686985) capital gains via their etf share class in creation/redemption trades.

**treatments**

you'll be taxed at long-term capital gains rates on:

* qualified dividends (dividends from a qualified issuer/holding held for at least 61 days)
* capital gains on holdings sold after being held for more than a year
* long-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund

you'll be taxed at ordinary income rates on the remainder:

* non-qualified dividends (non-qualified issuer or holding period)
* short-term gains (sold when held for a year or less)
* short-term capital gains distributed by a mutual fund
* non-exempt bond interest

**rates**

tax rates by income bracket & filing status may be found [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/qualified_dividend#tax_rates). note that the income thresholds are effectively higher / shifted due to the [standard deduction](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/standard-deduction). the long-term capital gains rates are applied by considering the long-term gains income as being stacked on top of ordinary income (including short-term gains).

[this calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) may be helpful in estimating your federal & state tax burden for a given gain.

there's no automatic withholding of taxes on any of this taxable investment income (realized/distributed gains, dividends, interest). you may need to make quarterly estimated tax payments around the end of the quarter with this income, or increase any salary/paycheck withholding by submitting a new form w-4 to your employer, in order to avoid underpayment penalties later for not meeting the minimum payment or safe-harbor thresholds.

gx6100,Varnu,I ignored my impulse to market time and it saved me tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.,"I'm a Boglehead and passive investor through and through. But I acknowledge that there are people and institutions out there who have the resources, specialized knowledge and contacts to actively invest, time and hedge.  Warren Buffet isn't just lucky.

In mid-February, I understood that the COVID-19 was going to become a worldwide crisis that would impact travel and the ability to go about our daily business.

tmdm3d,VanillaSkittlez,"Is there a general Boglehead philosophy around buying a house (to live in, not rent out) as opposed to investing?","About me: I’m 26 and a high earner, 6 figures, living in NYC. 

All of my friends are saving up to buy homes. Problem being, a beater home on the outskirts of NYC costs 600k, 700k minimum. My family’s here so I’m not particularly interested in moving in the near future. 

I know diversification of assets is important, but I’m failing to see how a house is in any way advantageous. Can someone maybe critique my thinking? I’d love to hear alternate points of view. 

Assuming I’m buying a house/condo to live in, and not rent out… it just doesn’t make sense to me. At my age, I feel like the biggest thing to focus on is asset accumulation. With the recent market downturn (not timing the market, but objectively we are not at an ATH), I feel like buying up as many shares in index funds right now is the best thing I can do for my future. 

To buy a 700k home, I’d need 20% down to avoid PMI. That’s a 140k down payment!! I would have to sit on cash that’s depreciating really quickly, and amass 140k to my name before I even think about buying. That also seems like an opportunity cost to not invest. 

Then there’s closing costs, property taxes, the interest payments on the mortgage. What scares me is that anything that goes wrong in a house, is my responsibility to fix. As someone who is not great with their hands, presumably that means hiring contractors for renovations or fixes. Which means I also need large cash reserves on hand, which speaks to, again, opportunity cost. 

Even worst case projections indicate the stock market can yield 4% real returns, but real estate can be 0-1.5% real, plus all the cash I need on hand, plus being in a ton of debt without flexibility, plus having risk associated with a physical asset. Even when I pay off the mortgage it’s not liquidity - it’s just “worth something” I can’t cash in or use. 

I am 100% in equities at my age. 80% US/20% INTL split and only buy index funds - VTI/VXUS primarily. 

I just don’t understand for the life of me how buying a house makes sense. The stock market seems like the clear winner, financially speaking. The insane amount of cash I need to have on hand at all times seems like such a sunk opportunity at my age.

t79tp7,ValueTheories,The S&P 500 has become very concentrated in the last couple of years,,390,0.96,65,Bogleheads,3/5/22 8:49,
szveu4,ValueTheories,"I analyzed 30,000+ stock recommendations by financial analysts to see if past success can predict subsequent returns","If an analyst makes 50 stock recommendations that outperform the market, does that mean his subsequent recommendations are likely to beat the market as well? Likewise, if some analyst makes 50 bad recommendations, does that indicate that his future stock picks will be bad?

That is the question I want to answer.

Using historical analyst recommendations data from Yahoo finance - Thanks Nobjos! - I compared analysts' earliest recommendations versus their subsequent recommendations. My reasoning is that if past successes can predict future returns, then the performance of analysts earliest recommendations should correlate with performance of subsequent recommendations.

A central question is how long of a track record is sufficient to gain insight in future performance. As a start, let’s try 50 stock recommendations. Below I’ve plotted the 4-month performance of analysts’ first 50 stock recommendations (x-axis), and compared it to the performance of all of the analysts’ recommendations since then (y-axis).

https://preview.redd.it/h18dk0w9lrj81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef78b9ae16d04fafff6fd15876857904565c525c

The exact correlation is -0.083, which is very low. This means that the first 50 stocks have no (or even a slightly inverse) correlation with subsequent performance. Basically, if an analyst did well early, it does not mean they will do well in subsequent predictions. **A good example to illustrate this is Wolfe research: their first 50 recommendations performed on average 2.8 (absolute) percent over the S&P 500. However, their subsequent 81 recommendations underperformed by a whopping 5.4%.**

If you’re wondering about the outlier on the left. That's BofA (deez nuts). No seriously, BofA Securities, Inc., previously Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), who's f**irst 50 recommendations underperformed the S&P 500 by a disturbing 9.5%**. If you had seen their track record back then, you probably never would’ve listened to them again right? Well, **their subsequent 242 stock recommendations averaged an amazing 3.3% over the S&P 500.**

But you might think “*Well if 50 stocks isn’t enough of a track record to predict future returns, what about 100?*” Here’s how that looks:

https://preview.redd.it/hmbguydqkrj81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a34306568d82ea8bc385e1d5d2be695c5fe731ef

Again, it’s a complete mess with no discernible correlation. This time, the exact correlation is -0.062. *A lot of large firms had a negative track record up till this point, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup, Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank. Yet all of these would go on to outperform the market in their subsequent recommendations.* But you wouldn’t know that if you just looked at their first 100 recommendations.

So what number of stocks is sufficient to be a reliable indicator of future returns? 200? 300? 500? 750? Well, the problem is that very few investment firms actually recommend this many stocks, so the data will be quite weak for a statistical analysis. But I did it anyway:

||Correlation with subsequent returns|N|
|:-|:-|:-|
|First 50|\-0.083|66|
|First 100|\-0.062|58|
|First 200|\-0.086|35|
|First 300|\-0.079|24|
|First 400|\-0.241|21|
|First 500|0.095|19|
|First 750|0.293|15|

Now, I want to say that this dataset is far from perfect. For instance, I think it’s unreasonable to think that the performance of first 400 recommendations vs. subsequent recommendations are really that highly inversely correlated. At the same time, I think that if there really was a high correlation between early and subsequent performance, this statistical analysis could’ve picked it up. As a final note, I will say that I trust this data more in light of previous research. Indeed a lot of research indicates that past performance does not correlate highly with future success. Famously, Daniel Kahneman has calculated the year to year correlation of professional investment advisors to be 0.01.

**Conclusion:**

Past performance does not (meaningfully) predict future returns.",152,0.96,17,Bogleheads,2/23/22 18:31,"if an analyst makes 50 stock recommendations that outperform the market, does that mean his subsequent recommendations are likely to beat the market as well? likewise, if some analyst makes 50 bad recommendations, does that indicate that his future stock picks will be bad?

sye9ud,TissueWizardIV,Lifecycle of a Boglehead,"# Part 1: The Virgin

I started out like like many of you. I had some extra cash from my college job. I stumbled upon some random Youtube video talking about savings accounts and mortgages and such. They mentioned S&P 500 index funds and 8% returns and I thought, ""Hey that's great!"" And so I put my money into an S&P 500 mutual fund. I was pretty happy. But then the demonic thought struck me, ""If my money is going to be invested, shouldn't I try to put it into the investment that will make me as much money as possible?""

# Part 2: Performance Chasing

Shortly thereafter I discovered QQQ. There was one article showing how QQQ had returned over 700% since 2010 while the S&P 500 returned just over 200% and the Dow was even worse. ""700% is so much better than 200%! I'm going to invest in QQQ!"" I even put money into TQQQ. Oh those were such innocent times.

# Part 3: The Stock Picker

In order to reaffirm my beliefs that QQQ was the best fund out there, I read many articles talking about growth. These often compared growth to value, and mentioned that value historically has beaten growth. ""More outperformance?"" I thought. ""Sign me up!"" I read about Buffett and finding cheap but great companies. I wanted to be like him. So I googled the best value stocks. Micron came up all over the place. It was at $85 and falling. I thought, ""It was so much higher before, this looks really cheap now!"" All the analysts were saying Micron was a great stock with 20% upside, 40% upside, 60% upside. There was no way I could go wrong! Two days in a row it went up 3-5%. ""The momentum is going back up! Now is the time to buy!"" I sold half of my QQQ and put it into Micron. I was so happy with my research. Almost like clockwork it immediately fell the next week. I kept holding on. I read every article from seeking alpha and everywhere else about Micron. Over and over I reaffirmed my beliefs that it was coming back up. It didn't. After a couple months I sold for a $500 loss.

The stress of huge intraday swings, watching the market every day, reading every article on my portfolio, and being constantly in the red was awful. I hated it. ""I'm done with individual stocks. I'm sticking to index funds from now on."" In hindsight, I'm glad I only lost $500 learning this lesson.

# Part 4: Birth of a Boglehead

I still wanted the best returns possible on my investment, so I continued pursuing factor investing. I eventually stumbled upon Ben Felix's Youtube channel on factors, and then just kept watching everything else he made. I listened to Rational Reminder every week and discovered the Boglehead community from random searches on factor investing. I learned about diversification, international investing, factors, bonds, taxes, account types, staying the course, low fees, and everything else I could. This info not only helped me craft a portfolio that fit my needs but helped me understand so much better how that portfolio will behave and not to be surprised. Just keep buying. These lessons have made my emotional burden with investing so much lighter.

# Part 5: Bogle Transcendence

During this period I discovered Optimized Portfolio and, because investing research had become my hobby a long time prior, I obviously read every article on the site. Amazing work there. Without that site I would never have learned about long term treasuries being the best diversifier to stocks or about (\*suspenseful pause\*) leverage. \*bogle screams in his grave\*. I started investing in hfea and ntsx. I read all of the major reddit and original forum posts about hfea and leverage. Hopefully it will give me financial freedom much earlier in life than I could achieve otherwise.

# Part 6: Moving On

I spent a lot of time on r/bogleheads and r/letfs. Eventually, everything become redundant. Almost every post was about the same things. There wasn't a lot of new stuff to learn or do. Trading strategies do get pretty advanced, but I've got no interest. My goal was to make more money, not less lmao. But that's the goal, isn't it?

vdjg69,TheTwoOneFive,Why working at a financial firm taught me to go the Boglehead route,"I've been a Boglehead for about 10 years now; before that all of my investing was doing stock picking. Overall I had some winners and losers, but never did great.

Shortly after the Great Recession, I joined a prop trading house in a non-trading role. Learned a lot there, but the biggest thing I will always remember is that I should never try to go up against those firms. Unless you have inside information, you will NEVER have as much information at your fingertips as they do. When I left, this place had quite a bit, beyond the obvious large number of traders:

* A five digit number of servers, many of which are constantly ingesting market data and determining where opportunities can be found

* Hundreds of developers and other technologists, whose job is to create programs to understand the market data feeds and present the best opportunities for traders as well as instant evaluations for things like risk. When I say instant, I mean their processing time was measured in microseconds when I started there and nanoseconds when I left. 

* Multiple research teams who would be diving deep into SEC filings and reviewing other news for quick analysis of what that meant for that company and how other companies would be affected

* Dozens of quantitative analysts (""quants""), most of whom had PhDs and would be developing trading models in tandem with the traders at the firm

In short, if you think you've got a soon-to-be ""hot stock"" that nobody knows about yet, odds are others not only do, they've evaluated it and determined the risk/reward ratio is not optimal. You may get lucky, but odds are you will lose out more often than you will win.

rxly8r,TheJimiHat,A respectful discussion on dividends,"I want to start by saying u/misnamed is an absolute legend and I appreciate the time you’ve put into making this sub a great place. That being said, I want to have a light hearted discussion on dividends, after yesterdays post saying dividends are meaningless. I watched the video, and I feel I grasp the core concept he was teaching, but still find myself disagreeing, even as an indexer. 

I want to throw my hat in the ring and say, “no, dividends aren’t meaningless, they have a place”. 

I want to start out by mentioning where I am in agreement. I believe the following are absolutely true:

-	Chasing dividend yield is meaningless.
-	Only buying a company (or paying a premium for a company) because they pay a dividend is meaningless
-	in many cases a business may be better served by not paying a dividend and reinvesting that capital back into the core business so that it can grow.
-	Yes, dividends are a tax drag on a portfolio. Totally true. The video demonstrated this point super well.


Now, hear my humble case for why dividends DO matter:

-	Dividends provide people in retirement or close to retirement a mechanism to live off of income that has better tax treatment than ordinary income (qualified dividends)
-	Dividends provide investors a mechanism to get a return on capital without selling shares or chipping away at their portfolio’s principle. This is especially important in retirement, where you don’t want to drain your fund any time you need money.
-	Dividends can act as a stabilizing mechanism in down markets. Reliable companies will still pay their dividend even in a down market (dividend aristocrats), especially if nothing has changed about the underlying core business. This isn’t always the case, but is *often the case*.
-	“dividends decrease the stock price by the amount the dividend is paid”. I don’t think this is true. Mathematically plausible, sure. But the stock market is emotional. In the short term, meaning days or weeks, this will be true, you can expect share price to decrease by dividend payout. Because the ex dividend date payout is priced in. But the market is fickle, and more often than not those companies prices will jump right back to their price before, and continue to grow afterward. In this sense you get a return on capital in the form of a dividend, and get to leave your stock alone and let capital appreciation continue to do its thing over years to come without needing to sell shares.
-	The point above is even more true when you look at companies with a high prospect of growth like Apple or Microsoft who aren’t dividend aristocrats. Their share price doesn’t correlate at all to their dividend payout. You just can’t count on a stocks price to go up or down relative to its dividend. 


I consider myself a Boglehead first and foremost, I wouldn’t call myself a dividend investor, or dividend growth investor or anything like that. But I absolutely love receiving my quarterly Vanguard dividends, reinvest them as soon as I can, and plan on using dividends as a form of income down the road when I’m closer to retirement or in retirement. I believe the dividend snowball is an absolutely real thing. 

Dividends do matter. But chasing yield, and ONLY investing in a company for its dividend is a recipe for disaster. 

So continue indexing, and gather those index’s dividend each quarter and watch that passive income grow. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

yu60us,TheBackpacker2,How do you find the balance between enjoying your money (and youth) and long term investing?,"I hope this is allowed here, please tell me if it isn't

So I'm 21, only started educating myself on investing in the last couple months.

I got a little money saved up from working (and living at home lol) and I'm planning on investing about 15k$ of it in some long term savings account (still need to iron out the exact details), which I'm sure is just small change to most people here, but it's a lot to me 😅

I'm also leaving on a huge backpacking trip in less than 2 months, something that's been a dream of mine for years. So I've diverted some money into the traveling.

I thought it makes sense at least idk)

sm37dg,THAC0-Tuesday,Fidelity ZERO Fund Mythbusting,"FZROX and FZILX come up a lot around here, which makes sense since they are easy to combine for global equity exposure at 0% expense ratio.

# They're Not Really Diversified: FALSE

FZROX contains 2,631 holdings; FZILX contains 2,386 (as of December 31, 2021). Combined, they fall short of VT's 9,364 holdings. However, if you look at the total list of holdings for each fund and how much weight each company represents in the index, the top 300 or so companies make up the lion's share of value. In VT, once you get past 2,333 companies, each of the rest represent less than 0.01% of the fund. Let me repeat, I like VT and think it is good. But I also see VT held up as the gold standard for diversification to the point that anything other than VT is regarded as inefficient. Remember that the introduction of the S&P 500 index fund in 1976 was regarded as socialist, anti-American investing for representing so many companies' value at once and removing so much homework from investing. VTSAX brought what could be considered ""true"" total market investing in 1992, followed by VTWAX for global investing in 2019.

To make an intra-company comparison, FZROX's size and style makeup mirrors that of FSKAX, just as FZILX does for FTIHX. Is FZILX missing small cap international? Yes. Could each Zero fund stand to hold more companies? Sure. Would those companies tilt the indexes' performance so much? Not to a significant enough degree to rule them out, imo. Are the Zero funds as diverse as possible? No, but that doesn't mean they're not pretty gosh-darn diverse to the point of reflecting total market value already. And if the companies they leave out are for the reasons outlined in the indexing methodology (liquidity, market cap, trading volume), then there's at least a rhyme and reason to it.

# The Zero Funds Are Loss Leaders: TRUE

They attract investors with the 0% expense ratio in the hopes of selling other financial products like advisory services, ATM/credit cards, and market funds outside the Zero group. Also, as far as I'm aware, ~~the Zero funds are not offered in any 401k/403b/457b plans, so there's still plenty of money to be made offering more expensive funds to corporate retirement plans.~~ (thanks for keeping me honest, u/Big_Dick_Balla! Some retirement plans DO offer the Zero funds, nice.)

In addition, “Lending securities to earn income for the fund” appears in each prospectus. Fidelity's making money off the shares owned by the indexes.

# Fidelity Keeps The Dividends For Themselves: FALSE

The dividends are reinvested throughout the year, with an annual distribution to the investor. The claim “Fidelity is taking your dividends!” pops up every so often with certainty, when that is not the case. Would quarterly dividends perhaps be more useful for certain withdrawal strategies in retirement? Sure. But Fidelity's not robbing investors by using an annual distribution schedule.

# You Can't Transfer The Zero Funds To Another Brokerage: TRUE

Yup!

Any other claims that you see pop up from time to time?

# FZILX Doesn't Include Emerging Markets: False

FZILX contains 25.55% emerging markets, as compared to 24.70% in VXUS and 28.25% in FTIHX. (thanks u/Cruian!)

&#x200B;

**Full disclosure**: I think holding Zero funds in tax-advantaged accounts and VTI+VXUS in taxable is the most efficient way to go. Holding mutual funds in a taxable account will generate greater taxable events than ETFs.

# they're not really diversified: false

fzrox contains 2,631 holdings; fzilx contains 2,386 (as of december 31, 2021). combined, they fall short of vt's 9,364 holdings. however, if you look at the total list of holdings for each fund and how much weight each company represents in the index, the top 300 or so companies make up the lion's share of value. in vt, once you get past 2,333 companies, each of the rest represent less than 0.01% of the fund. let me repeat, i like vt and think it is good. but i also see vt held up as the gold standard for diversification to the point that anything other than vt is regarded as inefficient. remember that the introduction of the s&p 500 index fund in 1976 was regarded as socialist, anti-american investing for representing so many companies' value at once and removing so much homework from investing. vtsax brought what could be considered ""true"" total market investing in 1992, followed by vtwax for global investing in 2019.

to make an intra-company comparison, fzrox's size and style makeup mirrors that of fskax, just as fzilx does for ftihx. is fzilx missing small cap international? yes. could each zero fund stand to hold more companies? sure. would those companies tilt the indexes' performance so much? not to a significant enough degree to rule them out, imo. are the zero funds as diverse as possible? no, but that doesn't mean they're not pretty gosh-darn diverse to the point of reflecting total market value already. and if the companies they leave out are for the reasons outlined in the indexing methodology (liquidity, market cap, trading volume), then there's at least a rhyme and reason to it.

# the zero funds are loss leaders: true

they attract investors with the 0% expense ratio in the hopes of selling other financial products like advisory services, atm/credit cards, and market funds outside the zero group. also, as far as i'm aware, ~~the zero funds are not offered in any 401k/403b/457b plans, so there's still plenty of money to be made offering more expensive funds to corporate retirement plans.~~ (thanks for keeping me honest, u/big_dick_balla! some retirement plans do offer the zero funds, nice.)

in addition, “lending securities to earn income for the fund” appears in each prospectus. fidelity's making money off the shares owned by the indexes.

# fidelity keeps the dividends for themselves: false

the dividends are reinvested throughout the year, with an annual distribution to the investor. the claim “fidelity is taking your dividends!” pops up every so often with certainty, when that is not the case. would quarterly dividends perhaps be more useful for certain withdrawal strategies in retirement? sure. but fidelity's not robbing investors by using an annual distribution schedule.

# you can't transfer the zero funds to another brokerage: true

yup!

any other claims that you see pop up from time to time?

# fzilx doesn't include emerging markets: false

fzilx contains 25.55% emerging markets, as compared to 24.70% in vxus and 28.25% in ftihx. (thanks u/cruian!)

&#x200b;

**full disclosure**: i think holding zero funds in tax-advantaged accounts and vti+vxus in taxable is the most efficient way to go. holding mutual funds in a taxable account will generate greater taxable events than etfs. this doesn't necessarily bust a myth, but tax-efficient allocating is important to one's investing strategy, and several comments reflect that."

Just a FYI for those not crazy about investing in regular old Total Bond funds right now and are in the market to purchase fixed income products in their portfolios.

All the data is out there to compute the I-Bonds rate for November, and someone did. For those looking to diversify their long term fixed income holdings, getting locked in at this rate for 6 months starting in November may be a good idea. You'd have to wait a few weeks until the calendar flips to November to buy.  Too bad there is a $10K yearly cap on direct buy-ins per SSN, but at least one can buy in again in January for the same rate.

You can also see that COLA on Social Security is going up 5.9% for those who take it or have family/friends that do. U.S. income brackets, 401k, IRA, and other retirement account limits all take inflation adjusted increases, so we will see soon how those change for 2022.

11omtt9,Soaperhiker,How do index funds make you money?,"I am not smart, so Bogleheads investing is probably great for me. It is probably easy for a lot of people to understand index funds in a flash, but I am still trying to. If index funds are always cycling funds (can we use total us stock market fund as an example?) then when you sell 40 years after buying, a lot of companies are no longer there that were in the beginning. You lost your chance to sell them and get a return. Of course, some companies have grown in the time you've owned the fund, but that may only be 10 to 15 years, not the 40 you've owned the fund for. 

Do you get significant dividends from total us stock market index fund? When the fund rebalances, do you get money? As I understand, market cap weighted funds buy high and sell low.

do you get significant dividends from total us stock market index fund? when the fund rebalances, do you get money? as i understand, market cap weighted funds buy high and sell low.

tiii78,Small_Journalist5470,How To: Set And Forget Automated Boglehead Investing at Schwab,"If you are at Schwab and don’t want to switch to Vanguard, this guide will show you how to…

-	Automatically invest 15% of your paycheck each pay period in 60% US, 40% INTL index funds. 

You can easily change this allocation to your liking. But I’ll use this for example’s sake.

Before we begin. A couple notes worth mentioning:

-	Yes, these are mutual funds, so they are a TINY bit more expensive in terms of cost basis than ETFs, but to you will make up more than that difference, just by having this system on autopilot.
-	This part confused me at first: In order to set up auto investing with Schwab you must first OWN at least one share of the thing you want to set up auto investing for. So buy one SWISX and one SWTSX before you start this process I listed above. If you’re confused call the Schwab support number. You’ll get a human in 5 mins or less. They’re excellent as I’m sure you know.
-	This frustrated me: Because there are several steps to setting this up which require fund transfers, it will probably take a week or 2 to get everything exactly as you want it. 15 minutes here… (wait 2 days for transfer to clear)… 15 minutes there… etc. You won’t be able to set the whole system up all at once. Just be patient. It’s worth it once it’s set up. 
-	The only true disadvantage I’ve found to this approach is that I believe SWISX does not expose you to SMALL cap international stocks which may create a slight deviation in performance compared to say… “Total world excluding US” funds such as VXUS at Vanguard. But again. I thought it was worth stomaching that small negative, for the huge positive of having auto investing in place.

We will be using Schwab’s auto investing feature for mutual funds. It will take a bit of setup but once you get it set up it can automatically invest a percentage of your paycheck each pay period at your desired allocation. 

Do not confuse “automatic investing” with Schwab’s “Schwab intelligent portfolios” the intelligent portfolios thing is just schwabs robo advisor. That’s not what we’re looking for. 

To find automatic investing:

In Charles Schwab, you have to go to “Trade” along the top menu, then click “Mutual Funds” from the sub-menu, and then you’ll see that you have two options — to trade mutual funds, or another option, “Automatic Investing,” which lets you set up automatic investing instructions for funds that you’re already in.  

Without further ado, here’s how to set up the system:

1.	Set your checking account to make a scheduled transfer of 15% (or whatever percentage of your paycheck you want to invest each month) into your investment account at Schwab once per pay period, a couple days after you get paid. So if you get paid on the 1st and 14th of each month, set the transfers to happen on the 3rd and 16th just to allow time to be 100% sure that your check is fully deposited and available in your checking account.
2.	Now you’ve got 15% of your check going into your investment account each month. Now you just need to auto invest it. So let’s say you want to do 60% US, 40% international. And let’s pretend that 15% of your paycheck is $1000 just for examples sake. Set Schwab auto investing to buy $600 of SWTSX and $400 of SWISX a few days after you have scheduled the money to transfer into your investment account. So In this case… on the 18th and 20th of each month. 
3.	Rebalance once a year. Aka, if your international has performed so well over the course of a year that it’s grown to 70% of your portfolio when you want it to be 60%, then sell 10% of it and buy domestic U.S. SWTSX with it to keep your desired 60/40 US/INTL split. 


There you go! Automatic investing!

I hope this helps you! I’ve been running it this way for awhile now and it’s pretty worry free once you get it set up! Prevents my dumb monkey brain from trying to time the market or reallocate my percentages when little blips in the market happen. 

Resources:
-	Me. Seriously. Send me a message if you have issues I’d love to help. I researched this for hours and hours just to do it once. Might as well use that knowledge I have kicking around in my brain to help someone else haha. 
-	Schwab support. They are really awesome and if you explain the concept of what you want to do they will help you with the technical aspects.

na61r3,Shitheadthegreat,PSA for new(ish) and young(ish) investors...You need an HSA,"I've seen the mods make several comments lately about the rapid number of new users on this sub.  So, I feel like there is chance to reach some people who may be in the sweet spot for capitalizing on the value of an HSA.  I really wish that at 25 (instead of 45) I had known about the investment value of an HSA.  If you're in good health and your employer offers you a High Deductible Health Plan with an HSA  you should probably look into taking advantage of that. 

In my case, since my wife and I are covered by the HDHP we can contribute $7200/yr to our HSA.  We are required to keep $2000 in cash in that HSA.  Every other penny that we contribute gets invested (we auto invest in VTSAX right through our HSA, every 2 weeks.)    


Why an HSA?

1. you contribute pre-tax dollars..not paying taxes on money you earn is good.
2. Your money grows tax free.  The magic of compounding over years and years without being taxed is a the secret sauce to growing your net worth (well, that and savings rate).
3. If you withdraw money for qualified medical expenses it is tax free.  That means you're spending money you never paid any taxes on.  
4. If you have the money to cover minor medical expenses you don't actually have to reimburse yourself from your HSA.  You can just leave all that money in the HSA, invested, and watch it grow over the years.  Just save your receipts because you can reimburse yourself later (any time later, eg 2060) for a medical expense incurred in 2021!  That gives your contributions years and years to grow before you withdraw them to cover an expense.
5. At 65 you can withdraw from an HSA for any reason without penalty.  However, if the withdrawal isn't for medical expenses you will have to pay tax on the withdrawal.  Seriously though, the odds are exceptionally good that at age 65 you'll have plenty of medical expenses.  So you pull from the HSA to cover them with income (and growth) you've never paid taxes on. 
6. When you eventually do get on Medicare you can use your HSA to cover Medicare premiums, copays, deductibles.  That's a significant retirement expense that you have covered!

HDHP and HSA can't possibly be right for every situation but if you're young, healthy, and could potentially cover the high deductible in the event you need it, an HSA an excellent investment/retirement vehicle.

w8jgj2,ScaredNewGrad,Milestone - 100K NW @ 25 years old,"Hi fellow bogleheads, this past weekend, after getting a hefty bonus at work, I have finally passed my first major milestone of 100k networth at 25 years old.

Some high level information about me.

\- 25 Male

\- Degree in Computer Science, graduated in Spring 2020 making about 85k a year at my first gig.

\- Graduated with no debt, went to community college for a few years, then fast tracked the last 2 years of my degree in about a year and a half, a total of about 25k paid for by my parents, insurance money from an accident as a kid and 1 very small scholarship.

\- Currently working my 2nd job in tech where I make about 135k to 145k a year depending on bonuses.

And here is some more detailed information about me.

I started invested in a Roth IRA at 20 years old (2017) while I was still in undergrad, investing about 300 dollars a month into VOO (back when it was \~$220 a piece, remember those days?).

In fall of 2018 I diversified my portfolio a bit to be in a few different sectors, I got a few funds such as VCR,VPU & VGT and I still hold some quantity of those funds today.

All through undergrad I continued to invest what I could every month sometimes 300 and sometimes 600 or more depending on how much I worked/spent that month but I was always consistent and pretty much never missed a single month to sock away a couple hundred bucks. I was able to work 2 jobs some semesters and pretty worked all the last 2 years of undergrad, which coupled with living for free at home, was super helpful with my savings goals.

When I graduated and was looking to move out, I decided to consolidate my accounts and make sure I had a clear view of my networth and from Day 1 of my career I have been investing anywhere from 15% to 27% of my income every month, watching it grow a ton since getting my first and then my 2nd big boy job.

Here is my overall networth growth for the last 2 years, starting from about 18k when I opened this account to now about 102k.

Here is the general mix of my portfolio

Cash: 23k (mix of checking account , short terms savings, and emergency fund)401k: \~19k (this is just for my current job which I have not been at very long)

Roth IRA: 41k (a chunk of this is from a ROTH 401k rollover from my first job)

Taxable Brokerage: 15k (about 2k of this are individual stocks my first job gave me as compensation)

HSA: 3k

When I started I had very clear headed people I followed online that spoke of passive investing as a way to get rich and nowadays it seems like the financial media is chock full of influencers using \*\*way\*\* too many buzzwords and over gamifying investing, which is not and has never been my style.

I think this just goes to show that following the bogleheads' method is the way to go.

i think this just goes to show that following the bogleheads' method is the way to go.

i hope this posts shows someone out there, younger or older, that investing steadily and keeping track of how much you save can be seriously fruitful in the long run.

i love some good tips so if anyone can maybe see where i should be doing better please let me know!"

147ddan,Ready-to-learn,"Ran numbers this weekend, hit a huge (for us) milestone, yet still feel completely hopeless and discouraged","Hello all

So my wife and I combine all finances and always have. as a result, we treat our retirement savings as one pie as well. After looking at our account balances we finally crossed the **$100K** mark in retirement savings (combined)!! I was so happy and so proud! for about 5 minutes... until I started looking at any retirement calculator that shows us so so far away from our goal, it just seem hopeless. Why are we even trying... What are we doing wrong? We only seriously started saving about 5-6 years ago, but our salaries really ballooned (more than doubled) in the past 2 years. The Details...

* Age both - 42
* Combined current salary (gross) - $140,000
* Total annual amount we save for retirement (combined) this is net purchases, so including employer contribution - $36,000
* Total saved for retirement across 401Ks, and IRAs - $103,000

Across all accounts I aim for a 60/40 split all equities, no bonds. Currently we're at

* US Markets - 60.65%
* International Markets - 39.35%

According to every calculator I find online when I input these numbers, we're not on track for anything, and so far behind needing to invest thousands more per year, between kids and life that's just not attainable.

mprovj,RagingBeaver194,Thank You,"I would like to thank everyone on this forum and those who have helped me on my very short investment journey. I always knew that I wanted to take control of my finances and become financially independent, and this forum has given me direction on how to achieve this goal. Seeing as the internet has been my only source of investing advice (my parents use a financial advisor who sells them actively managed mutual funds and stock picks and my friends are either uninterested or are market timers) I am glad that I landed here and not on TikTok day traders.

At age 18, I feel very fortunate to have discovered the Bogleheads style of investing. Thanks to you guys, I have maxed out my Roth IRA twice with total market index funds, and have a few thousand in a brokerage account invested in them as well.

To quote Rick Ferri, one among many that I look up to:

The four stages of successfully index fund investing:
Stage 1: Darkness (know nothing about nothing)
Stage 2: enlightenment (discovered that you're better off not trying to beat the market)
Stage 3: Overcomplicate everything (trying to beat the market WITH index funds).
State 4: Simplicity - own the total market and move on with life

I can certainly relate to these stages. While I knew some things about investing before coming in (my money was in a mutual fund that underperformed the index from the age of 13 to 17 in a custodial account) I did not know that index investing was a thing. Eventually I found some speeches by J.L. Collins and Jack Bogle that peaked my interest in index investing, leading me to join this forum. I had been enlightened.

Then, I learned about factor investing. Oh boy. I was trying to figure out ways to increase my return over the long run by adding Emerging Markets, Small Cap Value, etc. I went down the rabbit hole and was at a point where I was truly trying to beat the index in an almost active management kind of way. At this point, I realized that what I was doing was not what I had in mind when I was in the enlightenment phase. I was violating the first principle of indexing, which is that over the long run, the chances that any investor or fund manager will consistently outperform the market are slim. By then, I had read every small cap value and slice and dice debate here to exhaustion. I eventually came to the realization that I was OK with total market returns and that tinkering was not only unnecessary, but that I would likely end up doing something stupid like changing my strategy because I found one that is more optimized or abandoning it all together if it were to underperform the market. Whereas before I thought that I could handle a part of my portfolio underperforming the market for 20 years, I realized that in reality I would likely not be able to. 20 years is longer than I have been alive. 

I had done it. I had reached the phase of Simplicity. By reading some of the stories on this forum, this has taken some people years or even decades to achieve, and I could not have done it without all of you. I feel blessed. Thank you all. R.I.P Jack Bogle.

uxuq8w,RONALDGRUMPF,58 year old with roughly 120k in retirement account (401k). How to proceed?,"I should preface by saying I am not the 58 year old. I am a close friend and coworker who cares dearly about this person and her retirement. So with that said I do not know every single detail of her life and finances. 

She started saving for retirement late, which is why her balance is relatively low for someone her age. Right now she is 100% in a blue chip growth fund inside of the 401k, and I believe is contributing around 8% of her paycheck. I urge her to increase her contributions, but she is in the process of paying off some minor credit card debt, and also is a single woman who pays most of her bills her self (with some help from her adult sons). 

With that said, my real question at this point is weather or not she should stay in the blue chip fund, or maybe reallocate into something more conservative. With her age she needs to play catch up a bit, so I feel that a blue chip fund is relatively conservative while also having the potential for significant growth. I also really don’t want her to face a taxable event in transferring her money into another fund. 

She is a really great person who has gone through a lot in life and works so hard in a difficult retail job, so I want more than anything for her to have a pleasant retirement. 

Any advice or recommendations greatly appreciated!",222,0.93,54,Bogleheads,5/25/22 20:02,"i should preface by saying i am not the 58 year old. i am a close friend and coworker who cares dearly about this person and her retirement. so with that said i do not know every single detail of her life and finances.

rqf05j,Peacetoletov,Comparing US vs ex-US is not a fair comparison,"This is yet another post demonstrating why having international exposure is important, however I will try to prove a point that hasn't really been talked about much.

Comparing any country's historic stock returns to US's historic stock returns is not an apples to apples comparison. To understand why, we must ask ourselves why we are comparing with US in the first place.

US makes the majority of the world market cap, but this wasn't always the case. This means that during the process of becoming the country with the largest market cap, it must have had extraordinary stock returns, by definition. In other words, you are selecting the best performing country and comparing it with others, which is known as selection bias.

In 1990, you wouldn't be looking at US vs. ex-US. You would instead be looking at Japan vs. ex-Japan, and if you decided that you don't need ex-Japan exposure based on the past returns, you would have had very bleak returns coming forward.

I'm not saying you cannot under any circumstances compare US to ex-US, however you must do it in a period where US didn't make up the majority of the market cap. A fair comparison would be in years 1950-1990. Unsurprisingly, the returns were very similar in this period.

10t3uis,Oojin,TLDR: my company seems to be trying to hide the increased fees. Update on company changing to Voya:,"So last year I posted about my company changing to Voya. Since then my colleagues have been alerted to the change and I found out that many of the upper management did not even know about the increased fees. People are getting very disappointed in the company.

[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/z54wf3/voya_fml/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Fast forward 1 month and they are holding an educational session with the retirement consulting group that “helped” my company change 401ks. We were able to ask questions which of course I took advantage. The presenter went on about Voya being one of the best providers and how we should all be using it because we can compound 6% and how it’s low cost etc. Queue my questions about what are the fees. Of course he said he wasn’t sure and had his coworker look them up. Next question how can I justify encouraging my staff to use the 401k when they can barely max an IRA? Of course he said it’s more convenient and comes with retirement tools and professional management (for a fee). Next I asked why did we have to go from a 0 fee plan to .51 min excluding fund fee? He said we save money other ways. That’s when I had him. I brought up the math of compounding and fees showing an additional 1mil net loss with new plan. The silence was deafening. After a while he said he’d have to check the math and could talk to me in private (the call was being recorded). Fast forward another month my company sent out a recording of the other meeting without me in case anyone missed the meetings. Guess they don’t want people to hear that benefits are deteriorating. Fun fact presenter is the VP of a large consulting firm.

It costs me about forty USD to transfer my cash from my country to the brokerage, which stands a very high ratio to my overall assets. So next time I transfer I need to accumulate more.

(For your information, the minimum wage in my county is about 900 USD a month.)

Because I’m a not an American, I use a taxable account, it will charge my dividend for 30 percent.

I have some sub-brokerage services, because of some reasons, I have not decided to use these.

I also invest in a domestic index ETF which contain top fifty companies in my country. The problem is the expense ratio is about 0.4%, much higher than Vanguard ETFs. The second problem is diversification.

I used to pick stocks something like NLY, BRMK, MVO, CHKR, (which are providing extremely high dividend), INTC, F, IP, PFE, C, DOW, PARA, BAC, KEY, GOOGL, JPM, VWAPY, POAHY etc. Those company looks cool but I don’t really understand what I was doing. A few months later I realized that I fell in some traps. I originally think that I can earn money by picking stocks, and now I know it’s much harder than I think.(even 90%hedge funds managers v.s.

uz3va8,None,Voicemail from a financial advisor prompted me to passively invest part of a windfall today,"Happy Friday all, using a throwaway account today. 

I’m a Boglehead in my early twenties that received a windfall due to a life insurance policy a couple of months back. It was all very unexpected as it took forever for everything to be processed. The windfall was in the high six figures and I decided to deposit these funds in a new bank account so I could compartmentalize and avoid lifestyle creep with the account I use for my day to day life. 

Well the sum raised some eyebrows at this new bank and their financial advisors called me a few days after this deposit. At this point I had a taxable account and a Roth that I’d been making monthly contributions into. My AA was roughy 90/10 between VT and GOVT. I followed the sub and owned the book, so I knew I was going to be a passive investor for the long haul. But the much larger account kind of put some pressure on me that I’d never felt before. So I took a meeting with the financial advisor for this bank branch. 

I thought they may have some interesting points on taxes, asset allocations, or something interesting that I maybe hadn’t thought of before. 

I was dead wrong. I was basically presented with three plans. An advisor lead plan with their local guy, a bank lead plan with an all in one portfolio, and some front loaded mutual funds. The entire thing was just a sales pitch for high expense ratio products, the lowest being the bank lead mutual fund at about 1%. The financial advisor I was speaking with had a 1.5% fee and was actively trying to sell me on 5% front loaded funds. I kinda strung the meeting along a bit for my own curiosity, but I knew I wasn’t going to be paying these exorbitant fees. 

That meeting was in February, I’ve taken the time since then to pay down all debt, max my tax advantaged accounts, and come up with an AA. I’m basically just going to DCA it all into a three fund over the next year. I’d planned for four equal installments, the first was going to be next Tuesday. Up until I got a call from this FA today. 

I let it go to voicemail. The jist of his message was that he could still see that I hadn’t invested any of the money in my account. “It’s not going to do anything sitting in cash. We have some very conservative options if you’re afraid of volatility.” 

I was planning on Tuesday anyhow so I figured I’d move my timeline up a few days as a bit of a middle finger to exorbitant fees and grifters if he could see my investment account. So I bought in today and now I feel great.

i thought they may have some interesting points on taxes, asset allocations, or something interesting that i maybe hadn’t thought of before. 

i was dead wrong. i was basically presented with three plans. an advisor lead plan with their local guy, a bank lead plan with an all in one portfolio, and some front loaded mutual funds. the entire thing was just a sales pitch for high expense ratio products, the lowest being the bank lead mutual fund at about 1%. the financial advisor i was speaking with had a 1.5% fee and was actively trying to sell me on 5% front loaded funds. i kinda strung the meeting along a bit for my own curiosity, but i knew i wasn’t going to be paying these exorbitant fees. 

that meeting was in february, i’ve taken the time since then to pay down all debt, max my tax advantaged accounts, and come up with an aa. i’m basically just going to dca it all into a three fund over the next year. i’d planned for four equal installments, the first was going to be next tuesday. up until i got a call from this fa today. 

i let it go to voicemail. the jist of his message was that he could still see that i hadn’t invested any of the money in my account. “it’s not going to do anything sitting in cash. we have some very conservative options if you’re afraid of volatility.” 

i was planning on tuesday anyhow so i figured i’d move my timeline up a few days as a bit of a middle finger to exorbitant fees and grifters if he could see my investment account. so i bought in today and now i feel great.

qr7hcg,None,Market timing diary: how a regular guy like you predicted 9 of the last 1 crashes,"Periodically, we get posts on here of people with doubts about the market. Today, between Evergrande, crypto, and lord knows what else, there are plenty of reasons for uncertainty. I don't have an investing diary, exactly, but I have a pretty good account of my own investor sentiment since I started investing in 2013. My approach was Bogle-inspired, although as I note, I shifted a bit (often for bad reasons). I thought I might share them, as a good representation of timing the market, as well as illustrating other cognitive biases one might have (e.g. the way we can become overcommitted to a strategy once we have emotionally invested in it). 

January 2015: I started to get worried when the Shiller forward P/E went above 25, the level it was before the 2008 financial crisis. I have generally fretted about this, and the Buffet indicator (market cap: GDP) since then. I did shift my portfolio from being 100% domestic to include international index funds at this point (not that it did any good).  

November 2016: I thought Trump winning the 2016 election would tank the markets (actually it did briefly upset overnight futures markets). It didn't, of course. Rather, the market boomed. 

October 2017: I still remember the cover of The Economist. ""The bull market in everything"". I was sure that there was something afoot. There would be a few subsequent moments that felt like ""now it's about to start"". In February 2018 the VIX surged as the trade war accelerated and the Fed raised rates above 1%. There *was* (and this points to the difficulty of timing) a sharp correction in December 2018, but the market almost immediately recovered.    

August 2019: the yield curve inverted, and once again I began to thought that the end was nigh. There was going to be a recession and that was it. The rise of the S&P 500 into early 2020 felt suspicious to me. Arguably, this is the one time my gut might have been right. *But* I was right for the wrong reasons. The crash of 2020 was caused by the pandemic, which I obviously hadn't considered in August 2019 (nor even in January 2020). 

March 9, 2020: now, those were crazy times my friend. Some days were up double-digits and some were down by the same. It was circuit breaker city, man. Critically though, the signs of a financial crisis were there - repo markets were drying up and even treasuries were dropping.On March 9th I came damn close to shifting large amounts of my portfolio into bonds. I still have the trade confirmation, though I stopped it at the last second. The S&P 500 had fallen to something like 2800.  

April 9, 2020: I held through the bottom, when a strange thing started happening. The market recovered very rapidly. In a few days the S&P 500 was up from a low of something in the 2200s to almost 2800. I thought there was no way it could keep going like this. I remember looking at graphs (which people were posting widely at the time) showing the market through the Great Depression. One of the striking takeaways was that it hadn't just been down down down followed by recovery. There were so many bear traps. Could this be one of them? It was at this point that I broke from Bogle advice. As the market recovered, I shifted modest amounts into bonds reasoning that when the real bottom appeared I would buy everything cheap. A completely irrational factor in my move: relatives bragging that they saw the crash coming and pulled everything out just in time. 

 June 6, 2020: as my fear of bear traps receded, I reverted back to my long-term optimal portfolio. One day later, the market saw the biggest crash since the heady days of March. A-ha! I thought. It turns out I was right all along. And *of course* I was - unemployment had just hit the highest levels since the Great Depression, some states were prematurely reopening from the pandemic, etc. I didn't sell everything, but I maintained an overly bond-heavy portfolio for my age (mid-30s). As the market rose further in July and August, I continued to shift assets to bonds (I also shifted my bond holdings to TIPS which did work out... so far). 

 September 2020: through August I had read the story about Softbank's sometimes insane bets on tech, and was again sure that a crash was nigh. I felt bearish - one day I went running in the woods and literally saw a family of black bears crossing the road. And indeed, the S&P 500 started to correct (the Nasdaq somewhat more). And yet... pretty soon after, it was back to normal. 

January 22, 2021: this story involves my active trading account, which represents a very small proportion of my investments. When GME started to surge to $65 (vs. $4 in August 2020) following the beginnings of the campaign on Wall Street Bets, I was sure that the stock would fall. I bought OTM puts. When it rose more, I bought more OTM puts - and I even was able to time the peak correctly the second time. Obviously, the first set of puts became worthless, but interestingly, so did the second because I had bought them when volatility was so high that the stock would have to hit ridiculously low levels for my puts to print.      


I'm sure that there are other folks out there who are better investors than I. Maybe they have the time to do research and find diamonds in the rough. Maybe they have the discipline to avoid going double or nothing (and to resist confirmation bias) when their theses prove false. And hey, maybe they are smarter and possessed of some abilities that I lack. But I would have to say that the smartest thing I've ever done is to ignore my instincts, saved, diversified, and waited.",237,0.97,47,Bogleheads,11/10/21 18:40,"periodically, we get posts on here of people with doubts about the market. today, between evergrande, crypto, and lord knows what else, there are plenty of reasons for uncertainty. i don't have an investing diary, exactly, but i have a pretty good account of my own investor sentiment since i started investing in 2013. my approach was bogle-inspired, although as i note, i shifted a bit (often for bad reasons). i thought i might share them, as a good representation of timing the market, as well as illustrating other cognitive biases one might have (e.g. the way we can become overcommitted to a strategy once we have emotionally invested in it). 

january 2015: i started to get worried when the shiller forward p/e went above 25, the level it was before the 2008 financial crisis. i have generally fretted about this, and the buffet indicator (market cap: gdp) since then. i did shift my portfolio from being 100% domestic to include international index funds at this point (not that it did any good).  

november 2016: i thought trump winning the 2016 election would tank the markets (actually it did briefly upset overnight futures markets). it didn't, of course. rather, the market boomed. 

october 2017: i still remember the cover of the economist. ""the bull market in everything"". i was sure that there was something afoot. there would be a few subsequent moments that felt like ""now it's about to start"". in february 2018 the vix surged as the trade war accelerated and the fed raised rates above 1%. there *was* (and this points to the difficulty of timing) a sharp correction in december 2018, but the market almost immediately recovered.    

august 2019: the yield curve inverted, and once again i began to thought that the end was nigh. there was going to be a recession and that was it. the rise of the s&p 500 into early 2020 felt suspicious to me. arguably, this is the one time my gut might have been right. *but* i was right for the wrong reasons. the crash of 2020 was caused by the pandemic, which i obviously hadn't considered in august 2019 (nor even in january 2020). 

march 9, 2020: now, those were crazy times my friend. some days were up double-digits and some were down by the same. it was circuit breaker city, man. critically though, the signs of a financial crisis were there - repo markets were drying up and even treasuries were dropping.on march 9th i came damn close to shifting large amounts of my portfolio into bonds. i still have the trade confirmation, though i stopped it at the last second. the s&p 500 had fallen to something like 2800.  

april 9, 2020: i held through the bottom, when a strange thing started happening. the market recovered very rapidly. in a few days the s&p 500 was up from a low of something in the 2200s to almost 2800. i thought there was no way it could keep going like this. i remember looking at graphs (which people were posting widely at the time) showing the market through the great depression. one of the striking takeaways was that it hadn't just been down down down followed by recovery. there were so many bear traps. could this be one of them? it was at this point that i broke from bogle advice. as the market recovered, i shifted modest amounts into bonds reasoning that when the real bottom appeared i would buy everything cheap. a completely irrational factor in my move: relatives bragging that they saw the crash coming and pulled everything out just in time. 

 june 6, 2020: as my fear of bear traps receded, i reverted back to my long-term optimal portfolio. one day later, the market saw the biggest crash since the heady days of march. a-ha! i thought. it turns out i was right all along. and *of course* i was - unemployment had just hit the highest levels since the great depression, some states were prematurely reopening from the pandemic, etc. i didn't sell everything, but i maintained an overly bond-heavy portfolio for my age (mid-30s). as the market rose further in july and august, i continued to shift assets to bonds (i also shifted my bond holdings to tips which did work out... so far). 

 september 2020: through august i had read the story about softbank's sometimes insane bets on tech, and was again sure that a crash was nigh. i felt bearish - one day i went running in the woods and literally saw a family of black bears crossing the road. and indeed, the s&p 500 started to correct (the nasdaq somewhat more). and yet... pretty soon after, it was back to normal. 

january 22, 2021: this story involves my active trading account, which represents a very small proportion of my investments. when gme started to surge to $65 (vs. $4 in august 2020) following the beginnings of the campaign on wall street bets, i was sure that the stock would fall. i bought otm puts. when it rose more, i bought more otm puts - and i even was able to time the peak correctly the second time. obviously, the first set of puts became worthless, but interestingly, so did the second because i had bought them when volatility was so high that the stock would have to hit ridiculously low levels for my puts to print.      


i'm sure that there are other folks out there who are better investors than i. maybe they have the time to do research and find diamonds in the rough. maybe they have the discipline to avoid going double or nothing (and to resist confirmation bias) when their theses prove false. and hey, maybe they are smarter and possessed of some abilities that i lack. but i would have to say that the smartest thing i've ever done is to ignore my instincts, saved, diversified, and waited."

In real terms that means I’ve lost thousands and thousands — I definitely won’t sell, but it stings more than I thought it would.

I have a long investment horizon in front of me so I try to focus on that but it’s really tough to tune out the noise when everyone is saying how much worse it’s yet to get. It seems like I could not have started investing at a worse time.

My current plan to sort of psychologically cope with this is to focus on number of shares as my measure of progress rather than the share price and I try to look at it like “it’s on sale” but it may not be on sale if when I buy it it goes down more after so I don’t know if I buy that line of thought (maybe I’ve missed something).

1) taxable -> 100% VT (bought at 110 ow)
2) ira -> 100% Schwab TDF index

ph4xd5,None,I think crypto is inherently a bad long-term investment.,"I think people investing in crypto are ignoring the fundamentals and just chasing recent returns. I have seen people here say they put 20% of their portfolio in crypto.

I know I may be under Dunning Kruger effect so tell me if  I am wrong.

I will only consider Bitcoin. I know there are many other cryptocurrencies but they are less established.

By dollar, here I mean US dollar.

&#x200B;

**Argument**

I was reading about how a high dollar value will make American products more expensive overseas, which reduces the demand for American exports. It makes me think, if crypto became the mainstream currency in a country, that country's goods would become so expensive that the demand on their exports would tank. This would then tank their economy. I suspect countries may outlaw the use of cryptocurrency to prevent this. Some large countries such as Russia and China have already taken partial steps to outlaw cryptocurrency.

If crypto does not become the mainstream currency in any country, then crypto is more like a speculation than legitimate currency. However, unlike other speculation like antiques, art, real estate, etc. crypto has no inherent value.

I think there is a futuristic bias with cryptocurrency: it is heavily invested in because people think it is the future. Unlike stocks which have benefited from futuristic bias, like Tesla, cryptocurrency is just currency- it doesn't have growth/earnings potential.

Unlike currency such as gold, cryptocurrency can't be converted into jewelry, statues, etc. Gold seems similar to cryptocurrency in that it has a fairly limited supply, whereas the dollar is ""pretend"". As far as I know, no country currently uses the gold standard. Today economies run on ""pretend"" money which seems to work pretty well.

I did some calculations to show that crypto is hundreds of times more variable compared to real currencies. Also, its value is steadily increasing compared to other currencies, which seems very concerning to me. Real world currencies, as far as I know, don't behave this way unless an economy is collapsing.

I think the only way Bitcoin would be sustainable is if there was more inflation, but the algorithms are designed to prevent this.

I think a R\^2 test against the null hypothesis might be a better calculation, but I'm not sure how to do this.

If we account for time, we get this:

Dollar/euro: 2.44/30 years= 0.081/year

Dollar/yen: 1.82/25 years= 0.0728/year

Dollar/Bitcoin: 155/6 years=25.83/year

&#x200B;

Now compare using the Dollar/yen as the standard (1x):

Dollar/euro: 0.081/0.0728 = 1.11x

Dollar/yen: 0.0728/0.0728 = 1x

Dollar/bitcoin: 25.83/0.0728 = **354.81x**",163,0.7,531,Bogleheads,9/3/21 9:14,"i think people investing in crypto are ignoring the fundamentals and just chasing recent returns. i have seen people here say they put 20% of their portfolio in crypto.

i know i may be under dunning kruger effect so tell me if  i am wrong.

i will only consider bitcoin. i know there are many other cryptocurrencies but they are less established.

by dollar, here i mean us dollar.

&#x200b;

**argument**

i was reading about how a high dollar value will make american products more expensive overseas, which reduces the demand for american exports. it makes me think, if crypto became the mainstream currency in a country, that country's goods would become so expensive that the demand on their exports would tank. this would then tank their economy. i suspect countries may outlaw the use of cryptocurrency to prevent this. some large countries such as russia and china have already taken partial steps to outlaw cryptocurrency.

if crypto does not become the mainstream currency in any country, then crypto is more like a speculation than legitimate currency. however, unlike other speculation like antiques, art, real estate, etc. crypto has no inherent value.

i think there is a futuristic bias with cryptocurrency: it is heavily invested in because people think it is the future. unlike stocks which have benefited from futuristic bias, like tesla, cryptocurrency is just currency- it doesn't have growth/earnings potential.

unlike currency such as gold, cryptocurrency can't be converted into jewelry, statues, etc. gold seems similar to cryptocurrency in that it has a fairly limited supply, whereas the dollar is ""pretend"". as far as i know, no country currently uses the gold standard. today economies run on ""pretend"" money which seems to work pretty well.

i did some calculations to show that crypto is hundreds of times more variable compared to real currencies. also, its value is steadily increasing compared to other currencies, which seems very concerning to me. real world currencies, as far as i know, don't behave this way unless an economy is collapsing.

i think the only way bitcoin would be sustainable is if there was more inflation, but the algorithms are designed to prevent this.

i think a r\^2 test against the null hypothesis might be a better calculation, but i'm not sure how to do this.

lkpozk,None,Been 100% US Equities for over a decade and it's emotionally difficult to switch to global funds even if I know it's objectively a superior approach,"This is an element of the domestic/international debate I haven't seen discussed as frequently. I've often heard arguments against Bogle's claims that international investing is unnecessary explained as him ""coming from another era."" While this is of course likely true, there's also the fact that the sole task you have as a passive index investor is to ""stay the course."" Changing your equity asset allocation after a lifetime of doing it one way because modern economic literature tells you to feels like you are not staying the course.

I started investing in the early 2010s, and at the time I got the entirety of my information from Bogle, Buffet, and later JL Collins' blog. The approach of 100% VTSAX was promoted by countless FIRE bloggers as well and the concept of international investing was seen as an unnecessary complication. While it was difficult to ignore the noise of active trading and other methodologies, I fundamentally trusted this approach to be not only simpler but superior.

Now ten years later everyone is splitting their equities heavily into international. While it makes sense, I want to stress how difficult it is to adopt a new strategy after years and years of pounding the same approach into your head everyday. I imagine the majority of people on this forum are in their mid 20s and have been investing less than five years.

14i2uns,None,Opinion : Stocks have become less risky long-term due to gov't and fed intervention,"Something I've been thinking about. Here are a couple of reasons why I believe so:

(1) Any recession and elevated unemployment will be met with massive fiscal stimulus. Pandemic set a precedent with stimulus checks, unemployment extensions/top-offs, business support, student loan moratorium, eviction moratorium, etc. And remember this was bipartisan. The fiscal spending was much more than during the GFC, and now that a precedent has been set it's going to be politically difficult not to spent massively during the next recession.

(2) Too many institutions depend on the stock market. I will use my home state of CA as an example. The income tax structure is very top heavy, and obviously the wealthiest derive more of their income from stocks. This is why CA swung from massive surplus to massive deficits as the market swung from high to low in 2021-2022. I'm guessing a lot of other states also similarly depend on the wealthiest (and thus stock market returns) for revenue. And of course so does the federal gov't. Then there are also pension funds (many faced crisis during the GFC) and university endowments. It's not a huge exaggeration to say people's retirements, public safety, education, etc depend on the stock market. Nobody is going to come out and publicly say the gov't should prop up the stock market of course. But behind the scenes there is a lot of interest in the market doing well. I think this just goes back to (1) above, that a lot of forces will be aligned behind massive fiscal spending whenever a recession brings about a stock market collapse.

(3) The Fed will do what they can to keep the markets up. I know this may fly against what happened in 2022 as the market tanked and the Fed kept raising rates. But then the market has recovered quite a bit this year. I firmly believe the Fed would have paused earlier if the market was facing massive calamity. Keep in mind what the Fed and Treasury did to backstop regional bank deposits a couple of months ago during SVB's failure. And this is just a prediction on my part and we are probably far away from that, but I think the Fed would go so far as to directly intervene in the stock market and buy shares if need be (ala Japan's central bank). 

Now, the long-term downside to all this is more deficit spending and adding to debt. But I honestly believe the US still has a lot more room to add more debt as the global reserve currency. We are not even at Japan levels yet. You would think eventually something has to give and we could face a debt crisis, but I just cannot see that happening in the next 50 years or so. USD would have to lose its reserve currency status, meaning it would have to no longer be the dominant economic and military power but also there would have to be suitable substitutes. Eurozone and Japan are facing similar issues, and other currencies are not suitable for various reasons. 

Short-term downside would be inflation. And I do think we will face bouts of higher inflation than we did in the preceding 40 years. But I think the inflation we saw in the last 2 years is just as attributable to pandemic factors as fiscal/monetary policy. Going forward we may see brief spikes in inflation that are quickly tempered by the Fed. 

So I have put my money where my money is and raised the stock portion of my AA. I was 60/40, now I'm 70/30 and considering going as high as 80/20. Also pretty much getting out of long-term bonds and keeping duration short. I'm also reducing international allocation a bit and tilting more towards US. I was roughly 60/40 USA, my goal is to get it to about 75/25. Mainly because I think the US economy depends a bit more on the stock market than other countries, so not sure if other countries will be as aggressive trying to prop up the market long term as I'm predicting.

And of course I'm not saying there won't be volatility and short-term crashes. And individual stocks can still go all the way to zero. But I think long-term stocks now have a perpetual gov't AND Fed put.",152,0.87,52,Bogleheads,6/24/23 16:32,"something i've been thinking about. here are a couple of reasons why i believe so:

But they can’t make those bets at home without their work resources. So they don’t. They make too much money to risk losing any of it. When you couple that with the strict rules the SEC puts in place regarding insider trading, it’s just easier and smarter for them to buy index funds.

My original plan in my head was to just sell the shares as needed, thinking they’ll be way more than what I paid for them. Then I realized if I’m no longer working and selling shares, that could be a huge problem. As the shares will just be less and less. 

So I don’t really know how it’s done. I’m not too familiar with dividends as I just reinvest them. 

Is there a way to get $ without selling shares? I’m assuming that’s the dividend payment? How exactly does that work? 

Thanks for any info!

15zoids,No7onelikeyou,How do you balance a house payment and saving for retirement?,"You may or may not have heard the saying “buy one house, pay for two”, meaning typical interest as you know adds up to a ton over time. 

If a house is $300,000…..and someone has $300,000 then they can pay it off and just have the monthly expenses, property tax, fire insurance etc. if someone doesn’t have $300,000 and makes payments…..isn’t their total amount spent easily over $500,000? 

So $200,000+ basically thrown away on interest 


I’m not an expert, but I know it’s close 


How do you balance having say a 401k, maxing out a Roth etc and also buying a house? 

As far as maxing out all accounts/extra in a taxable account compared to putting in as much into the house principle to save on interest. It seems like the house interest isn’t mentioned enough 

Every time I hear that someone “bought a house” it’s never outright since it’s so much, as well as the person seemingly being oblivious to the couple hundred thousand lost on interest over decades

*— Jordan Bergman, Ames, Iowa*

**A:**

I see what you did there, Jordan. You sent me this right after, in the last issue of this newsletter, I said independence is one of the seven virtues of great investors. And how could the Bogleheads — people who own index funds, which just copy whatever the market is doing — possibly be thinking and acting independently? 

Well, how much independence does it take to buy and hold a few index funds *and do little if nothing else* when everybody else is chasing the hot returns of whatever just went up the most?

A lot.

How much independence does it take to stick with a simple *— and boring! —* plan when Wall Street's propaganda machine pumps out complex and exciting-sounding products every day?

A lot.

How much independence does it take to listen to Wally the plumber and Lucy the dentist bragging about their brilliant trades *when you don't make any?*

A lot.

So, yes, I think you can follow the philosophy of John Bogle, the late founder of Vanguard Group, without being a mindless member of the herd. In fact, if you're thoughtful about it, that could make you less likely, not more, to follow the crowd.

We build a *better* ship that will improve our chances to withstand a storm when it comes. Your portfolio is that ship.

You can tell yourself, ""Oh, I'm a long-term investor"". But, 2 years later, everyone around you who sold all their stocks is doing extremely well, and you are sitting on huge losses, it is hard to not start doubting yourself and everything you believe in. Experts and other bogleheads are saying for 2 years+ that you should not assume the previous lessons apply anymore, and they have been right for the last 3-5 years.

What do I do?,"basically, around my 21st birthday earlier this year I set up a robinhood account (I know, robinhood bad, whatever) and had decided to instead of using a 401k/roth I would use a brokerage firm like robinhood, fidelity, or webull. I figured I'd try to get some investing experience (just the whole idea/practice of putting money aside, budgeting 300 a month, etc) before I really committed to an actual 401k or roth, which is why I decided to use an app like that.

I have been DCA 300 (which will increase once I get a better job later down the line) every month into VOO but I moved over to VTI recently. I figured since I would probably start needing to do taxes soon, I had asked my mom if she could help me with setting all that up and just getting a feel for things. she showed me her tax form and the like, and the part where it asked for stuff like dividends, capital gains, etc, popped up.. I had mentioned I had made some dividends and investments since she clearly had 0 for all of them since she doesn't invest, and just saves her cash, and I didn't want her to just skim over it. 

immediately she looked at me like I told her I was doing drugs. she was like ""what the hell are you investing in? are you sure it's legit? do you know what the hell you're doing with your money?Let me see what you're doing"". So, I showed her my robinhood account and she was like ""what the hell, that's so much money for your age?? you better pull back because I doubt you know what you're doing"" and even though I said I only invested money I didn't need, and how I felt like it made no sense to leave money in my savings account doing nothing if I don't even spend it, she still was upset at me and it's like she was judging me.

p09rmq,MythrowawayAcc5678,Am I just missing something or is investing as a new investor really... easy..? It feels too easy,"Hello, so I have a few things in my portfolio, basically three ETFs (VOO, and two others) and three stocks I thought I'd have for just ""buy/hold/see where they end up"" growth stocks. However, I figured since recently, I would just put 300 dollars a month or more, but minimum 300 dollars a month into VOO, and if possible, either VOO and another one of those ETFs. My portfolio already is like, 70% VOO. I plan on just keep adding at least 300 or more to VOO every month, since I just turned 21 a few months back and that's a decent amount for me to put in every month. Soon my portfolio probably will just be 80-90% VOO or higher  


but the thing that gets me, is.. On paper, all the research I've looked at, simply just investing and forgetting into VOO, should, over the course of me just living my life, generate wealth to the point where I can either live off the dividends from VOO, or sell shares of VOO to then put into a dividend ETF. But, thinking about it, it just seems too easy. I've always heard people talking about the stock market being some crazy lottery or some scam, but so far it's been fine for me, and I don't panic if I see any dips because I know the top 500 companies are going to be fine in the long term.

But because I know that's my portfolio more or less, I'm not worried..   


But, am I missing something? It just feels, strange, that doing something so simple as just putting 300 into VOO over the course of me just living my life would generate a good investment.

but the thing that gets me, is.. on paper, all the research i've looked at, simply just investing and forgetting into voo, should, over the course of me just living my life, generate wealth to the point where i can either live off the dividends from voo, or sell shares of voo to then put into a dividend etf. but, thinking about it, it just seems too easy. i've always heard people talking about the stock market being some crazy lottery or some scam, but so far it's been fine for me, and i don't panic if i see any dips because i know the top 500 companies are going to be fine in the long term. especially since with voo/vti, if those are down, it's not like i could have done anything different anyway. it's different if say, 70% of your portfolio dips while vti/voo is still high and green. but because i know that's my portfolio more or less, i'm not worried..

DISCLAIMER: I'm here to initiate a discussion, not to prove a point. In fact, I'm here to invite criticism and opposing viewpoints. Please feel free to judge and challenge me! :)

Hey, I've frequently come across the claim that the S&P's annual return has been 10% over the past 100 years, which led me to ponder whether this is a reliable benchmark. After all, most investors won't be investing for a century; instead, they might invest for shorter periods like 30 years. What if this ""10% annual return over the past 100 years"" is actually a blend of 50 years with a 5% annual return and 50 years with a 15% annual return?

&#x200B;

In my opinion, a fair test would involve examining the annual return through rolling returns. This means simulating a graph that each time point, shows the rolling return we would have obtained if we had invested for 30 years at that time point. Then, (and only then), can we calculate the overall return we made in 30 years (let's call it X) and extract the annual return using the formula X\^(1/30).

&#x200B;

Such a graph would illustrate the annual return based on 30 years of investment for every historical period. To conduct my analysis, I obtained S&P 500 data from 1880, which unfortunately doesn't include Adjusted Close prices. To compensate, I manually added a 2.5% annual dividends return and accounted for a negative 0.15% annual return due to management fees.

&#x200B;

You can find the data I used from [Stooq](https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=^spx&i=d). Additionally, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500), the modern 500-stock version of the index started in 1957. However, there was apparently a 233-stock version that began in 1923 and a 90-stock version in 1926. I'm unsure about the precise mapping of these versions to the current one.

Code:

    etf = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(self._database_path, etf_name + '.csv'))
    etf_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(etf_data['Date']) etf_data = etf_data.set_index('Date') etf_data = etf_data.loc['1885-02-17':]  # No daily data before 1885-02-17
    etf['rpd'] = 1 + etf['Adj Close'].pct_change()  # rpd = return_per_day
    ANNUAL_DIVIDEND = 0.025  # 2.5% 
    ANNUAL_MANAGEMENT_FEE = 0.0015  # 0.15% 
    for n_years in [1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30]:
        overall_dividend_return = ((1+ANNUAL_DIVIDEND) ** years - 1)
        overall_management_fee = ((1+ANNUAL_MANAGEMENT_FEE) ** years - 1)
        etf[f'{n_years}_years_rolling'] = etf['rpd'].rolling(n_years * 252).apply(lambda x: np.prod(x)).shift(-n_years * 252) + overall_dividend_return - overall_management_fee
        annual_return = (etf[f'{n_years}years_rolling'].iloc[::100]) ** (1 / n_years)      # sample every 100 days for better visualization
        annual_return.plot()
        plt.title(f""annual return of rolling {years} years return"")
        plt.ylabel(f""Return"")
        plt.show()

The graph cut at 1993 because every point on the graph, shows the annual return we would got if we started a 30 years investment from that point.(Return such as 1.085 == 8.5% annual return)

From 1970 till today, results seems to be solid:

I also calculated the annual return based on a 3-year investment period to be able to examine more recent times.

&#x200B;

However, upon analyzing the past data. It appears that the stock market can be divided into three distinct periods:

1. Pre-1960: This period yielded an average return of 4%.
2. 1960-2000: During this period, the average return increased to 7%.
3. 2000-present: In the most recent period, the average return further rose to 8.5%.

I'm particularly concerned about the underwhelming results observed prior to 1960, and I find it difficult to believe the notion that ""it's a different world now from what it was in 1960."" People often use that argument to explain away historical patterns, but history has a tendency to repeat itself.

But that's not the full story. The people at Wall Street Bets are fine with gambling and so called ""loss porn."" The real problem is that Robinhood's main source of income is payment for order flow to a company called Citadel.

When you place a trade at Robinhood, they send the information to a market maker, most often Citadel. Citadel quickly purchases the security from a seller and then resells it to you. This is why there is a bid ask spread when trading stocks. Citadel serves as a middleman that pockets a few pennies in every transaction.

The problem is that Citadel is also one of the hedge funds that is shorting GameStop. They stood to lose billions of dollars in a short squeeze tomorrow. When Robinhood blocked the purchase of GME, but not the sale, the stock price tanked. This allowed Citadel to cover their shorts at a tenth of the price they would have had to pay tomorrow. This moved billions of dollars out of the hands of retail speculators into Citadel's accounts (along with a few other hedge funds such as Point72).

Robinhood is beholden to Citadel because most of their revenue comes from them. Fidelity is a private company beholden to its private owners. Schwab is a public company that is beholden to it's public owners. But Vanguard's ownership structure is unique. The fundholders are the owners of Vanguard. As such, they have no conflicts of interest. They don't sell order flow to hedge funds. They don't take the interest out of your cash accounts. They are only accountable to you.

mtawcv,MagicalThrowawayTour,A investing newbie who is becoming a Boglehead after a decade of myself and my wife screwing ourselves over and being inadvertently screwed over by others.,"\*Long post warning\*

Prologue:

I  went to school for accounting/business in the mid to late 2000s and became a CPA after. While I  took finance classes in university, the idea of investing didn't really dawn on me (which is stupid considering that I have a financial  background. As I finished my schooling in the early 2010s in my early  20s, I was buying and selling a certain large cap company on advice of my father because it had a great dividend and it was a safe company that a lot of everyone use in their day to day life but sometime around 2010-2013  ish (don't remember the specifics), he said don't buy anything because  it's really overpriced and the market will come crashing down at any moment. He said he had lost a lot of money on Black Monday in '87 and he  didn't want me to lose all my money. So I didn't invest it and put it  into a money market fund, waiting for the right time to buy. Every time I  asked, he would say ""it's way too high"". Little did we know that from 2008 would be the one of the biggest bull markets in history.

Eventually,  I realized that he is the type of guy who thinks things should always  cost $20 but really they cost $50 these days or simply put, he's stuck in the 1980s/1990s. It was the same thing when  my wife and I bought our first house a few years ago. He said don't offer anything above asking price (out of the corner of my eye, I saw our real estate agent smirking because she knew the market), we  eventually went about 7% over asking but we are happy with our house. My dad has been a general dentist for 40 years, so he is wealthy (not obnoxiously so but more than enough) so I think he doesn't realize what's it's like to be starting out or how cautious he can be because of his wealth.

So right now, I have not invested my money in anything for 8-10 years and boy I have been  kicking myself for it. I am not going to abuse hindsight to say I would have  bought all the BTCs or TSLA I could have but even just a simple index  fund would have done okay.

My  wife's story is much simpler but just as frustrating (married 3 years ago for context). She was not interested in investing at all or really financially illiterate so her father did all the investing.  Unfortunately, he only put her money in GICs because it was drilled into  him by his parents that if you invest in the stock market, you will lose everything. So he faithfully followed that advice.

My-in laws are farmers who plead poverty but are not poverish. Back 20+ years  ago, GICs were okay but now GICs are worth nothing. They could have put their money into safe dividend securities and doubled their money at  least. It just pains me to see what fear and general ignorance does to people. But to be honest, my father-in-law would probably check the stocks all day and see that they are going down and panic sell. It's not too late for them to invest but I don't think I can change their mindset.

My  wife used to be like her parents when we first got married. ""We could  lose everything!"" was her usual comment about investing to which my first response would be ""if all of the stock market goes to zero, we have a lot bigger problems"" and then my 2nd response would be ""where do you think your job pension comes from?"" but now she's stating to understand why it's important and how it's safer then it appears, plus she doesn't want to do real estate investing to become a landlord.

The interesting thing is that both of our fathers weren't wrong, it's just they weren't right in their assessment/methodology (with some hindsight of course). Warren Buffett made a great point once of living in  ""uncertain times"", he said that September 10, 2001 was an uncertain time, you just didn't know it yet. Also, the biggest lesson is ""Time in the market is better than timing the market"" and now we are looking at invest when everything is at an all time high.

Current - How I Stopped Worrying and Started to look at Index Funds (plus commentary on today):

I started my proper investing journey by reading The Intelligent Investor and I found some of it to be useful (the bits about buying bonds and cigar buds, not so much). I have also watched and read from Warren Buffett/Peter Lynch/Jack Bogle and all of them say ""for the average person, just do an index fund"". These are some of the most successful people giving our free advice. Buffett went so far as to post the results of a bet of his where he put the S&P Index against a group of hedge funds and in the end, S&P kicked ass compared to what the hedge funds did. The more I researched, the more it makes sense because our lives are so busy and there's too many rabbit holes out there to be sucked into or just meme stocks in general. Plus we don't really need dividends right now, only growth. The index fund should work for my wife because even though she's a risk adverse person, the ""set it and forget it"" should appeal to her. 

It amazes me how many people don't follow the index advice, maybe it's because it's too boring for them. ""Know what you own"" is the one of the biggest pieces of advice that I got from reading/watching and I don't know if a lot of people (at least on reddit) actually do - aka this DOGECOIN bs. To me, right now, the stock market is filled with degenerate gamblers (TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!). 

The hardest part of the index strategy is FOMO, and it's real. Not necessarily from GME/etc but other things in general. The index fund method is meant for average people and not meant to get rich quick or even get rich from being a smart investor (Mark Cuban once said that diversification is for idiots and concentration is how you build wealth (at least initially)). There could be undervalued stocks out there but in the age of information and technology that we live in, I think a lot of those sorts of secrets aren't staying secrets for long. 

In the end, I think we will go with a 100 % with Vanguard Index Fund where it's 80% equities and 20% bonds, starting with a lump sum and then DCA as we are able to afford it. It's a little uncomfortable that we are investing when everything is at all time highs but we have 30-35 more years to go so in theory, coupled with DCA, it shouldn't matter. I might allow myself maybe 5-10% of the portfolio as ""play money"" but nothing more than that.

t9uh5x,LuxGang,Could we be entering a lost decade?,"The traditional advice has always been to DCA into a broad market ETF and have a long term view.

This advice worked great when the Fed was always there to bail out the markets. However this time, interest rates are already at 0 and inflation is high. In all previous recessions /crashes, the Fed had this lever to keep the market/economy from falling apart. But with inflation where it stands, there's no appetite for more QE, and interest rates can't go lower. 

The difference this time is huge and I would argue that people shouldn't blindly invest in an ETF.

Are we looking at a potential lost decade or worse? I look at the Dow Jones and from 1965 - 1995 the market was down or flat. Horrible for anyone investing during those years.

I know these things are unpredictable, but it seems we're really trapped this time with inflation and interest rates where they are. Things really seem fucked, and after a 13 year bull market, I think we're about done. Trees don't grow to the sky after all.

zygwvp,Kashmir79,2022: The year a generation of Bogleheads learned about bonds,"I've been following the BH forum for almost a decade and this sub for about 2 years, and I've never seen so many questions about bonds as this year. It's not surprising since the Fed rate hadn't been higher than 2.5% since 2008 and suddenly this year it shot up more than 400 basis points for the biggest annual increase in half a century. The dramatic rate increase also sent stock prices tumbling for the biggest correlated stock & bond decline in most of our lifetimes. This was met with some new fixed-income enthusiasm for the increased yields, a lot of [shock at the loss of value of bond funds](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1114969/why-2022-has-been-such-a-terrible-year-for-bond-funds), and many questions about how bonds work. They are not nearly as simple as ""bonds = safety"", or even as simple as ""rates go up = bonds go down"" as many might have thought. So I decided to recap some of the information and links I remember reading or sharing dozens and dozens of times in 2022:

&#x200B;

1. ""Why did the value of my bond fund go down?"" seemed to be the question flooding the sub in the spring. Interest rate risk is a very real thing and it all ties back to your [bond fund's duration](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bonds:_advanced_topics#Duration): ""**The duration is approximately the amount by which the price of the bond will fall for every 1% rise in interest rates**."" That is the explanation for why BND - with a duration of around 6 years - fell by nearly 18% as the Fed rates climbed over 3% higher in an effort to fight inflation. At the extremes, EDV with a super long 25-year duration fell more than -50%, whereas SGOV with a microscopic duration of about 5 weeks never lost value and will end the year up about 1.3%. As in all allocation decisions, **your holdings need to be calibrated to your risk tolerance, goals, and timeline**. But if your fund lost value, fear not - when rates increase, the loss of value of your bond fund is temporary but the new higher yields mean you will actually come out ahead IF YOU HOLD TO THE AVERAGE MATURITY.
2. [I-bonds](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/i-bonds) became all the rage again at the end of last year as inflation soared to its highest points since the 1970's. These are a terrific place to park cash to keep it protected from inflation over the long term. They have a base interest rate (now more than zero!) plus an additional indexed rate to track the CPI - a rate that can never go negative. You can only buy $10,000 per person per year, but nothing in fixed income is beating them in 2021-22. They are great for an emergency fund, after you have accounted for the 1-year lockup period.
3. Finding the current yield of a bond fund is not the simplest matter. Many folks asked something like - my high-yield savings account is paying 3% but I looked up BND on Yahoo and it says the yield is 2% so why I would ever buy BND? Not so fast. The generic yield stat that many finance sites report is a 12-month average which would go all the way back to the end of 2021 when yields were much lower. ""SEC yield"" is another backward-looking statistic that reports the average yield of the last 30 days. This makes it easy to compare different funds, but in an environment where rates are shooting up every month or two, that can't keep up with what to expect going forward. Generally, the best place to get a sense of a fund's expected yield going forward is to go to the fund page and look up the *average yield to maturity* which [for BND](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd) today is 4.5%. Even this isn't an accurate picture because bond funds are always in the process of cycling in new bonds, now at higher rates - a process which can take longer depending on the length of the duration of the fund. So in all likelihood, the yield of a total bond fund will keep increasing until it gets somewhere around the historical norms of 1-2% above the Fed funds rate.
4. ""What bond fund should I hold"" came up again and again for folks trying to understand the differences between dozens of seemingly similar bond funds. I directed many people to [this excellent post by White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/bond-funds/) which runs down many of the basic bond fund components like treasuries, corporates, and mortgages, not to mention TIPS. Bonds can serve three main purposes - income,  diversification, and capital preservation - and you need to decide which is most important to you in order to choose a fund. Some people like to follow the mantra of ""take your risk on the equity side"" and keep their bonds safe in short-term treasuries which are the best at preserving capital. The best diversifier from stocks is still long-term treasuries, but **NOT THIS YEAR**, as correlated declines rarely but occasionally do happen in high inflation cycles. The highest yields come from corporate bonds - [a favorite asset class of Jack Bogle's](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/718645/bogle-corporate-bonds-a-sensible-way-to-pick-up-yield) \- and supposedly the ""fallen angels"" BBB-rated give you the best return on investment, although they are notably riskier and correlated with stocks. All told, a total bond fund with a mix of durations and types is still probably the best bet for the average investor *with a timeline of more than 6 years*. Money needed in a shorter timeline should probably be in shorter bonds or a bank HYSA.
5. Speaking of HYSA's, the game was on to find the best rates, and yields seem to be going up week by week. Whether parking an emergency fund or saving for a house, people are flocking to [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/) to find the next obscure online bank they've never heard of to move their money to get the highest interest (now over 4%). Credit unions in particular often have some of the most impressive rates. But if you get tired of this game, maybe consider a T-bills fund like SGOV or BIL which holds the same 13-week treasuries where your bank is investing your savings (and hoping to generate a profit). These will typically trail only the very best HYSA rates by a few basis points for maybe a few weeks but will keep going up with interest rates so you don't have to move around. And floating rate notes (USFR, TFLO) can do this even better because their rate resets weekly and they have an even higher yield thanks to their 2-year maturity. Both of these options are US treasuries so they are not subject to ~~federal~~ state & local income tax like bank savings. But beware, unlike bank savings accounts, you can only cash them out during market hours, they do still have interest rate risk, and their fees will offset their utility if/when rates get below 0.5% again.
6. TIPS surprised some people by not doing particularly great in an inflationary environment from 2021-2022. They did better than nominal bonds, especially short-term TIPS in the early arrival of high inflation, but they are still bonds with interest rate sensitivity. VIPSX for example is down more than -10% on the year. The distinction I would make about them is that TIPS may help protect *your bonds* from inflation, but they don't protect *your portfolio* from inflation, and bonds are not the asset class you hold to deal with inflation in the first place. Stocks are the part of your portfolio that will handle inflation the best over the long term, especially REITs and small-cap value. If you are retired and want an allocation to something that goes UP when inflation hits, that is probably commodities - you can listen to Frank Vasquez of Risk Parity Radio explain that in an amusing rant against TIPS at the 5:15 mark [in this podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/risk-parity-radio/id1525099266?i=1000547296583).
7. Finally, there has been a lot of discussion about whether one should hold individual bonds or CD's instead of a bond fund since you know with those you will get your principal back unlike bond funds which have dropped in value. It is true that these instruments will give you the most predictability, and that is especially useful for folks with low risk tolerance. But the idea that they don't lose value is actually something of an illusion. Most people who manage their own bond/CD ladder aren't marking to market their entire ladder every day so they don't see the spot price falling when interest rates rise the way you do with an ETF, but if they tried to sell the whole ladder on the secondary market it would certainly be worth less. [This blog post](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2022/11/owning-individual-bonds-vs-owning-a-bond-fund/) and [this study](https://www.northerntrust.com/japan/insights-research/2014/the-myth-of-holding-to-maturity) explain that holding individual bonds to maturity being safer is something of a myth.

Those are some of my highlights from the year in bonds. Did I miss something or get something wrong? I'm curious to hear what specifically others may have learned about bonds in this crazy year.",773,0.96,82,Bogleheads,12/29/22 16:24,"i've been following the bh forum for almost a decade and this sub for about 2 years, and i've never seen so many questions about bonds as this year. it's not surprising since the fed rate hadn't been higher than 2.5% since 2008 and suddenly this year it shot up more than 400 basis points for the biggest annual increase in half a century. the dramatic rate increase also sent stock prices tumbling for the biggest correlated stock & bond decline in most of our lifetimes. this was met with some new fixed-income enthusiasm for the increased yields, a lot of [shock at the loss of value of bond funds](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1114969/why-2022-has-been-such-a-terrible-year-for-bond-funds), and many questions about how bonds work. they are not nearly as simple as ""bonds = safety"", or even as simple as ""rates go up = bonds go down"" as many might have thought. so i decided to recap some of the information and links i remember reading or sharing dozens and dozens of times in 2022:

&#x200b;

1. ""why did the value of my bond fund go down?"" seemed to be the question flooding the sub in the spring. interest rate risk is a very real thing and it all ties back to your [bond fund's duration](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/bonds:_advanced_topics#duration): ""**the duration is approximately the amount by which the price of the bond will fall for every 1% rise in interest rates**."" that is the explanation for why bnd - with a duration of around 6 years - fell by nearly 18% as the fed rates climbed over 3% higher in an effort to fight inflation. at the extremes, edv with a super long 25-year duration fell more than -50%, whereas sgov with a microscopic duration of about 5 weeks never lost value and will end the year up about 1.3%. as in all allocation decisions, **your holdings need to be calibrated to your risk tolerance, goals, and timeline**. but if your fund lost value, fear not - when rates increase, the loss of value of your bond fund is temporary but the new higher yields mean you will actually come out ahead if you hold to the average maturity.
2. [i-bonds](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/i-bonds) became all the rage again at the end of last year as inflation soared to its highest points since the 1970's. these are a terrific place to park cash to keep it protected from inflation over the long term. they have a base interest rate (now more than zero!) plus an additional indexed rate to track the cpi - a rate that can never go negative. you can only buy $10,000 per person per year, but nothing in fixed income is beating them in 2021-22. they are great for an emergency fund, after you have accounted for the 1-year lockup period.
3. finding the current yield of a bond fund is not the simplest matter. many folks asked something like - my high-yield savings account is paying 3% but i looked up bnd on yahoo and it says the yield is 2% so why i would ever buy bnd? not so fast. the generic yield stat that many finance sites report is a 12-month average which would go all the way back to the end of 2021 when yields were much lower. ""sec yield"" is another backward-looking statistic that reports the average yield of the last 30 days. this makes it easy to compare different funds, but in an environment where rates are shooting up every month or two, that can't keep up with what to expect going forward. generally, the best place to get a sense of a fund's expected yield going forward is to go to the fund page and look up the *average yield to maturity* which [for bnd](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd) today is 4.5%. even this isn't an accurate picture because bond funds are always in the process of cycling in new bonds, now at higher rates - a process which can take longer depending on the length of the duration of the fund. so in all likelihood, the yield of a total bond fund will keep increasing until it gets somewhere around the historical norms of 1-2% above the fed funds rate.

11prp0b,Kashmir79,"HYSA, MMF, CDs, T-Bills... searching for the best return on cash? I prefer floating rate notes (FRN) treasuries ETFs.","Almost every day in this sub, someone posts about a good CD rate they saw, the highest HYSA yields, or questions about money market funds or setting up a treasuries ladder. These are all fine options for ultra-short liquid cash vehicles but my suggestion to anyone looking to get a consistently more competitive return (after i-bonds) is to consider a floating rate notes (FRN) ETF like [USFR](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/fixed-income/usfr) or [TFLO](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/260652/ishares-treasury-floating-rate-bond-etf), *especially* in a rising rate environment. These are what works best for my personal preferences and I'll explain why...

**Shortcomings of the popular options for cash savings**

CDs and treasury ladders require time and effort to set up and maintain and are not available on all brokerage platforms. Most CDs are not liquid so your cash is locked up which is not ideal for emergency funds. And if you aren't laddering, it is an interest rate gamble: ""locking in"" what seems like a good rate today could be locking you *out* of higher rates should they rise rapidly (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/11lwkha/worth_repeating_dont_try_to_time_the_bond_market/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

High-yield savings accounts are particularly handy if they allow instant transfers or ATM access for immediate cash in hand, and they can't lose value (although you could always run into solvency issues with your institution [like SVB this week](https://time.com/6262009/silicon-valley-bank-deposit-insurance/)). The other problem with HYSA's is that the rate is set by the bank and they can drop a promo or teaser rate, or drag their feet on increasing it when the Fed rate rises, which might send you looking for the next bank to move to. If your bank or brokerage offers a money market fund, they often do a better job of keeping up with rising rates, although the best-yielding of them, along with CDs and HYSAs, are not always state/local tax exempt.

**What are floating rate notes?**

Floating rate notes (FRNs) were introduced by the US Treasury in 2013. They are a form of US treasury bond that has a fixed duration of 2 years but the interest rate is variable and paid out quarterly. The interest rate of the FRN resets every week to the prevailing rate of 13-week T-bills, PLUS a fixed spread that is determined when the notes are purchased at auction (currently 0.20%) which compensates FRN holders for the longer maturities vs 13-week T-bills. This is sort of the inverse of TIPS which have a fixed base rate and then add a variable index rate (that fluctuates with the CPI).

The net result is that with FRNs, you are getting a higher yield than 13-week T-bills because of the spread, a yield that is roughly comparable to 2-year treasury bonds. But because the rate resets weekly, you have a lower duration and thus even less interest rate risk than the 13-week T-bills - the effective duration of FRNs is just one week, meaning it is essentially negligible.

**Treasury ETFs**

13-week T-bills are available in a constant ladder in ETFs like SGOV and BIL (expense ratios of 0.12% and 0.14%) which distribute a monthly yield almost like a savings account. These are cycling through bonds each week so when rates are rising, they will gradually adjust upward to the prevailing rate over the course of roughly 4-7 weeks (and the reverse when rates are falling). Most HYSA bank deposits are invested in 13-week T-bills or something similar, and hoping to make a profit on the difference between that yield and what they are offering you, so a T-bills ETF will generally get you a yield very close to what the best HYSA's are offering while cutting out the middleman. Plus, the underlying treasury holdings are all entirely backed by the full faith and credit of the US government (not only $250k like FDIC insurance at your bank), and they are state and local tax-exempt which can save you 5-10% on your yield in high-tax states like NY and CA compared to HYSAs and CDs.

While you can buy FRNs yourself from Treasury Direct, they are also available in ETFs, with two of the most popular being USFR and TFLO (expense ratios of 0.15%) which hit the market in 2015. These hold a group of 2-year FRNs and also distribute a monthly yield like a T-bills ETF. TFLO was designed with eight notes so there is one 2-year note expiring and being replaced with a new one each quarter over a 2-year cycle. USFR only holds four notes. This has caused a smidge more volatility for USFR because the spread will jump around a bit more than TFLO which has more holdings thus each spread change affects the fund's yield less. I believe the quarterly index yield should be the same for all FRNs but the added spread on each will vary based on when it was purchased and, as luck would have it with rising rates, USFR has benefited with slightly higher returns. I would expect the two funds to generate about the same return over the long run.

**What are the returns?**

[Here I set up a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2017&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=CASHX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=BIL&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=TFLO&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=USFR&allocation3_3=100) comparing USFR and TFLO (2-year FRNs) to BIL (13-week treasuries) and the benchmark CASHX (the actual ""risk-free"" return of 13-week treasuries bought from the US treasury). I only set it back to 2017 because in the first years of the FRN ETFs there was high volatility caused by newness as notes were acquired and AUM was building, and due to unpopularity because T-bill yields were under 0.25% so there was basically no point in holding them since they delivered no return (these funds lost money in 2015-16 and 2021 because the paltry yield couldn't outpace the fees). What you see is that the volatility has been about identical to 13-week T-bills, which is not surprising since they reset to the same yield each week and thus have only a 1-week duration. But thanks to the spread and being able to respond to rising rates faster, the returns for the FRN ETFs have been higher than the T-bill ETF, and are on par with what you would get from the risk-free rate of managing your own T-bills ladder. USFR has generated a return within at least 0.11% of T-bills every year, often besting it by a good margin, and is the only of these four assets to have beaten inflation in any year (2018) while coming close to doing so thus far in 2023.

Now that the Fed rates have come up and are expected to continue rising, everyone is looking for the best place to park cash and I think FRN ETF's warrant serious consideration. Take a look at these yields (after fees):

|ETF|Duration (yrs)|30-day SEC yield|Avg yield to maturity|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BIL|0.13|4.37%|4.74%|
|SGOV|0.11|4.49%|4.41%|
|TFLO|0.01|4.72%|4.85%|
|USFR|0.02|4.72%|4.94%|

Consider that these ETFs have negligible interest rate risk, evidenced by the fact that last year - the worst year for bonds in recent history when rates went up faster than ever before - they didn't experience any drawdown. The FRN yields are *consistently* about as high as you will find on any HYSA, CD, MMA, or even short-term Treasury bonds which have higher interest rate risk. the FRN ETF yields will automatically adjust upwards (or downwards) with Fed rate changes so you will always be capturing prevailing rates but not experience NAV losses when they shoot up unexpectedly (nor any NAV gain if they fall unexpectedly). They are fully liquid during market hours, and they are state and local tax-exempt (more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/11prp0b/comment/jc6vd7l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

For all these reasons, USFR in my taxable brokerage account has become my liquid ultra short-term savings vehicle of choice for things like emergency funds and large purchase savings or sinking funds. Below are a few links with more research and information - let me know what you think!

[The Case for WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR)](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/investment-case/the-case-for-floating-rate-treasury-fund-(usfr).pdf)",349,0.99,239,Bogleheads,3/12/23 18:17,"almost every day in this sub, someone posts about a good cd rate they saw, the highest hysa yields, or questions about money market funds or setting up a treasuries ladder. these are all fine options for ultra-short liquid cash vehicles but my suggestion to anyone looking to get a consistently more competitive return (after i-bonds) is to consider a floating rate notes (frn) etf like [usfr](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/fixed-income/usfr) or [tflo](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/260652/ishares-treasury-floating-rate-bond-etf), *especially* in a rising rate environment. these are what works best for my personal preferences and i'll explain why...

**shortcomings of the popular options for cash savings**

cds and treasury ladders require time and effort to set up and maintain and are not available on all brokerage platforms. most cds are not liquid so your cash is locked up which is not ideal for emergency funds. and if you aren't laddering, it is an interest rate gamble: ""locking in"" what seems like a good rate today could be locking you *out* of higher rates should they rise rapidly (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bogleheads/comments/11lwkha/worth_repeating_dont_try_to_time_the_bond_market/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

high-yield savings accounts are particularly handy if they allow instant transfers or atm access for immediate cash in hand, and they can't lose value (although you could always run into solvency issues with your institution [like svb this week](https://time.com/6262009/silicon-valley-bank-deposit-insurance/)). the other problem with hysa's is that the rate is set by the bank and they can drop a promo or teaser rate, or drag their feet on increasing it when the fed rate rises, which might send you looking for the next bank to move to. if your bank or brokerage offers a money market fund, they often do a better job of keeping up with rising rates, although the best-yielding of them, along with cds and hysas, are not always state/local tax exempt.

**what are floating rate notes?**

floating rate notes (frns) were introduced by the us treasury in 2013. they are a form of us treasury bond that has a fixed duration of 2 years but the interest rate is variable and paid out quarterly. the interest rate of the frn resets every week to the prevailing rate of 13-week t-bills, plus a fixed spread that is determined when the notes are purchased at auction (currently 0.20%) which compensates frn holders for the longer maturities vs 13-week t-bills. this is sort of the inverse of tips which have a fixed base rate and then add a variable index rate (that fluctuates with the cpi).

the net result is that with frns, you are getting a higher yield than 13-week t-bills because of the spread, a yield that is roughly comparable to 2-year treasury bonds. but because the rate resets weekly, you have a lower duration and thus even less interest rate risk than the 13-week t-bills - the effective duration of frns is just one week, meaning it is essentially negligible.

**treasury etfs**

13-week t-bills are available in a constant ladder in etfs like sgov and bil (expense ratios of 0.12% and 0.14%) which distribute a monthly yield almost like a savings account. these are cycling through bonds each week so when rates are rising, they will gradually adjust upward to the prevailing rate over the course of roughly 4-7 weeks (and the reverse when rates are falling). most hysa bank deposits are invested in 13-week t-bills or something similar, and hoping to make a profit on the difference between that yield and what they are offering you, so a t-bills etf will generally get you a yield very close to what the best hysa's are offering while cutting out the middleman. plus, the underlying treasury holdings are all entirely backed by the full faith and credit of the us government (not only $250k like fdic insurance at your bank), and they are state and local tax-exempt which can save you 5-10% on your yield in high-tax states like ny and ca compared to hysas and cds.

while you can buy frns yourself from treasury direct, they are also available in etfs, with two of the most popular being usfr and tflo (expense ratios of 0.15%) which hit the market in 2015. these hold a group of 2-year frns and also distribute a monthly yield like a t-bills etf. tflo was designed with eight notes so there is one 2-year note expiring and being replaced with a new one each quarter over a 2-year cycle. usfr only holds four notes. this has caused a smidge more volatility for usfr because the spread will jump around a bit more than tflo which has more holdings thus each spread change affects the fund's yield less. i believe the quarterly index yield should be the same for all frns but the added spread on each will vary based on when it was purchased and, as luck would have it with rising rates, usfr has benefited with slightly higher returns. i would expect the two funds to generate about the same return over the long run.

**what are the returns?**

[here i set up a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timeperiod=4&startyear=2017&firstmonth=1&endyear=2023&lastmonth=12&calendaraligned=true&includeytd=false&initialamount=10000&annualoperation=0&annualadjustment=0&inflationadjusted=true&annualpercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalancetype=1&absolutedeviation=5.0&relativedeviation=25.0&leveragetype=0&leverageratio=0.0&debtamount=0&debtinterest=0.0&maintenancemargin=25.0&leveragedbenchmark=false&reinvestdividends=true&showyield=false&showfactors=false&factormodel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarksymbol=cashx&portfolionames=false&portfolioname1=portfolio+1&portfolioname2=portfolio+2&portfolioname3=portfolio+3&symbol1=bil&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=tflo&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=usfr&allocation3_3=100) comparing usfr and tflo (2-year frns) to bil (13-week treasuries) and the benchmark cashx (the actual ""risk-free"" return of 13-week treasuries bought from the us treasury). i only set it back to 2017 because in the first years of the frn etfs there was high volatility caused by newness as notes were acquired and aum was building, and due to unpopularity because t-bill yields were under 0.25% so there was basically no point in holding them since they delivered no return (these funds lost money in 2015-16 and 2021 because the paltry yield couldn't outpace the fees). what you see is that the volatility has been about identical to 13-week t-bills, which is not surprising since they reset to the same yield each week and thus have only a 1-week duration. but thanks to the spread and being able to respond to rising rates faster, the returns for the frn etfs have been higher than the t-bill etf, and are on par with what you would get from the risk-free rate of managing your own t-bills ladder. usfr has generated a return within at least 0.11% of t-bills every year, often besting it by a good margin, and is the only of these four assets to have beaten inflation in any year (2018) while coming close to doing so thus far in 2023.

now that the fed rates have come up and are expected to continue rising, everyone is looking for the best place to park cash and i think frn etf's warrant serious consideration. take a look at these yields (after fees):

|etf|duration (yrs)|30-day sec yield|avg yield to maturity|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|bil|0.13|4.37%|4.74%|
|sgov|0.11|4.49%|4.41%|
|tflo|0.01|4.72%|4.85%|
|usfr|0.02|4.72%|4.94%|

consider that these etfs have negligible interest rate risk, evidenced by the fact that last year - the worst year for bonds in recent history when rates went up faster than ever before - they didn't experience any drawdown. the frn yields are *consistently* about as high as you will find on any hysa, cd, mma, or even short-term treasury bonds which have higher interest rate risk. the frn etf yields will automatically adjust upwards (or downwards) with fed rate changes so you will always be capturing prevailing rates but not experience nav losses when they shoot up unexpectedly (nor any nav gain if they fall unexpectedly). they are fully liquid during market hours, and they are state and local tax-exempt (more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bogleheads/comments/11prp0b/comment/jc6vd7l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

for all these reasons, usfr in my taxable brokerage account has become my liquid ultra short-term savings vehicle of choice for things like emergency funds and large purchase savings or sinking funds. below are a few links with more research and information - let me know what you think!

13hnyq8,Kashmir79,Debt Ceiling Megathread: Deep Breath… Your Investments Are (Probably) Going to be Fine,"Nearly every day, we are getting the same question in the sub that is causing investors anxiety: **What will happen if the US Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, and should I be making any changes to my portfolio in anticipation of that possibility?**

Instead of answering the same question a hundred times, I’m offering this post where we can all weigh in and the mods can pin it until the storm blows over. Federal government finance is not my wheelhouse but I’ll share my perspective and a few resources to get started…

First things first- let’s admit that this is anxiety-inducing for many people. The US dollar is the world’s reserve currency and US treasury coupons offer the ""risk-free return” which is the foundation of global finance. If the US Congress does not authorize increasing the debt ceiling and the government stops making debt payments at some point this summer, the consequences to global markets could be catastrophic and even “safe” assets like treasuries and money market funds would be threatened. This fear is the whole point of the theatrics. Without getting into a partisan debate about who is responsible, the political objective is to command attention on specific issues, rile up the populace, dominate media headlines, and force concessions in a high-stakes negotiation. And the media loves it because it drives to them the eyeballs and clicks and angry comments which support their business model. That's why I see inflammatory stories with terms like ""[the debt ceiling nightmare](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-debt-ceiling-nightmare-could-be-a-bond-and-gold-buyers-dream-30445b44)"" or headlines reading ""[How A U.S. Default Crisis Could Devastate Your Finances](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/debt-ceiling-hurt-your-finances/)"" (chuckle). 

Our job as Bogleheads remains the same as always: to **tune out the noise and stay the course**. This may sound trite, but you need to understand that the brilliant luminaries who built our community of passive index investing and the [3-fund portfolio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/) concept [were not ignorant](https://www.physicianonfire.com/read-250-investing-books-recommends-three-funds/) of the possibility of events like this. It’s not: tune out the noise… except for this debt ceiling thing, this time it’s different, and WE SHOULD ALL PANIC AND PULL OUT OF THE MARKETS NOW! No. We know better. People like Jack Bogle and Taylor Larimore have seen and lived through SO much worse than this. Jack grew up the son of a World War I veteran who lost his fortune in the Great Depression. Taylor was a paratrooper in World War II. They lived through periods when the great nations of the world - including the US - collapsed, convulsed, starved, were destroyed, and were then rebuilt. Passive total market index investing has been backtested through all of that ([150 years in the US](https://themeasureofaplan.com/us-stock-market-returns-1870s-to-present/), and nearly [400 years globally](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2911187)) and it works because markets are incredibly resilient [through much bigger calamities than we face today](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/special-episode-stock-bonds-and-war), so [take a deep breath](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2019/08/17/a-guided-meditation-for-when-the-stock-market-is-dropping/) and remind yourself: **your investments are going to be fine**. Throughout any point in the last four centuries you could have had a portfolio passively invested in global stocks, slipped into a coma for 30 years, and woken up with 5-10x growth, and today is no different.

What will actually happen if the US defaults on its debt? When will US treasury holders start receiving payments again? No one can answer that for you because it is unknowable. But [something similar has happened before](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-debt-ceiling-deadline-isn-204630951.html) so we have some idea about what to expect:

* In the run-up to the debt ceiling deadline, if an agreement is not reached, all markets will see increased volatility and the inverted treasury yield curve could distort even more in strange ways, possibly with lower ultra-short yields, higher short yields thanks to inflation, and still lower long yields with a recession expected. Not really sure.
* The US credit rating would probably get downgraded from AAA to AA+ or lower, and that should increase yields on all treasuries because they will be seen as a slightly higher credit risk. Higher treasury yields typically increase the cost of all debt and cause stocks to fall (as we witnessed last year).
* Once a budget deal is reached and payments resume (remember, this is a voluntary non-payment, not an issue of solvency), then yields will likely fall and both stock and bond markets may rally.

If you want more evidence of this and an analysis of what you should do about it, I highly recommend this article: [***Should You Protect Your Portfolio Against a Possible U.S. Debt Default?***](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2023/02/should-you-protect-your-portfolio-against-a-possible-u-s-debt-default/) TL;DR for long-term passive investors in accumulation phase, you should probably ignore it like any other noise:

>If our politicians fail to get rid of the stupid debt ceiling, we’re likely going to be having this debate once every few years. That debate might cause some short-term volatility in the markets but there is *always* the chance of short-term volatility in the markets.

Don’t try to time these events because you are apt to lose more than you gain by making timing mistakes. And don’t pull out of the markets into cash because where is your money going to hide from this problem? In a savings account? Banks invest your savings deposits in treasury bills! That’s how they can afford to pay you interest, so chances are they could be affected too. The potential domino effect on the entire financial system is so wide-reaching that the probability of it not being resolved quickly are barely plausible, and that's why Congress has managed to raise the debt ceiling in 78 out of 78 opportunities since 1960 (if my math is right, that's 100% of the time).

Nevertheless, some people are worried about what happens if the US stopped making payments for an extended period in more of a doomsday scenario. Maybe politicians are willing to crash the whole system now. Perhaps this the beginning of “de-dollarization” and the movement to a new world currency. I don’t personally believe that, and I suggest listening to a good retort to this concern by Frank Vasquez [at 15:38 of this Risk Parity Radio podcast episode](https://www.riskparityradio.com/podcast/episode/7b2dea20/episode-260-upar-de-dollarization-hysteria-and-using-risk-parity-portfolios-for-intermediate-term-goals). He cautions you not to fall into a possibility fallacy where you assume that just because something *could* happen that means it *will* happen. Prolonged US default remains an incredibly unlikely event because the political consequences are not going to be sustainable, or not for very long. And a change in reserve currency status is even less likely and takes a very long time.

That said, I do dabble in r/preppers (which is basically group therapy for anxious individualists with hyperactive imaginations) and, in many areas of life, it can help ease your mind to have some protection against worst-case scenarios. This is not financial advice, but I think there are a few rational things you could consider doing for your portfolio which may have the potential (not guarantee) to perform better in an extended US currency crisis, and most of them are portfolio best practices anyway:

1. Make sure you are internationally diversified in stocks. Sovereign risks exist in every country - including the US - and a dollar decline historically correlates to international stock outperformance. [Vanguard suggests](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/why-invest-internationally) having 20% minimum invested internationally.
2. Maybe have some of your bonds diversified internationally as well to [theoretically guard against](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=399465)[ deep risk](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=399465). Vanguard’s LifeStrategy and target date funds have about 30% of their bonds international. In the long run, this is unlikely to hurt or help your portfolio but might offer some peace of mind.
3. If you are retired, consider keeping an allocation to gold. I say “if you are retired” because studies show that [5-15% allocation to gold has improved portfolio performance](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/01/08/gold-hedge-against-sequence-risk-swr-series-part-34/) by reducing volatility and increasing safe withdrawal rates *in drawdown phase* thanks to non-correlation with both stocks and bonds. [Gold seems like it would be likely to benefit from a currency crisis](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gold-prices-winner-debt-crisis-bc12a4a4) so maybe it’s a little insurance, but I would not bother in accumulation phase because gold is just a long-term drag on returns and would thus be a market timing maneuver which I don't recommend. For the record, I don't hold any international bonds nor gold in my portfolio 10 years from retirement, but I probably will when I am retired.
4. [Have some paper cash in the house](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/vv6w5q/psa_keep_a_little_emergency_cash_in_the_house/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This sounds like Chicken Little to some people, but there are many historical examples where banks have had to temporarily restrict withdrawals. I DO NOT think this will happen but I always keep two weeks’ expenses in cash around - mainly for power outages from natural disasters - so it’s just one less thing to worry about.

Otherwise, I would heed the timeless advice from Jack Bogle when we went through this in 2011: “[Don’t just do something, stand there!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbarth/2011/08/09/bogle-to-investors-dont-do-something-stand-there/?sh=1eda2b502b47)” Let other people freak out, turn off the media, take a walk, and all your investments are (probably) going to be fine.

The fees on the total market index funds in our plan will drop from 0.26-0.41% to 0.04-0.11%, and target date funds from 0.70-0.91% (active) to 0.08% (index).

When I saw the low Vanguard fees in our new plan I almost cried. I’m already in my 40’s but, assuming I stay at my current company until retirement (and then presumably rolling over to an IRA), this would be projected to save me **TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS** in fees PLUS future earnings on that amount - possibly six figures of total savings into old age.

Cheers!",298,0.98,55,Bogleheads,6/8/22 12:51,"just wanted to express my delight that after some conversations with my company director and payroll manager, and 2 years of nudging on my part, our company is finally leaving its overpriced 403b provider for one with low cost vanguard funds. the fees on the total market index funds in our plan will drop from 0.26-0.41% to 0.04-0.11%, and target date funds from 0.70-0.91% (active) to 0.08% (index).

when i saw the low vanguard fees in our new plan i almost cried. i’m already in my 40’s but, assuming i stay at my current company until retirement (and then presumably rolling over to an ira), this would be projected to save me **tens of thousands of dollars** in fees plus future earnings on that amount - possibly six figures of total savings into old age.

11lwkha,Kashmir79,Worth repeating: don’t try to time the bond market.,"The Fed announced yesterday that the economy remains overheated and inflation higher than expected so interest rates will be increased higher and faster than previously assumed. In the past year, I’ve seen many posts from folks “excited” to lock-in 4% or more recently 5% nominal yields using multi-year CD’s or treasuries on the assumption that inflation and interest rates will soon fall, despite the fact that these yields remain a real loss. A decade of near-zero rates may be biasing people’s assumptions.

We now understand that Fed rates are headed still higher, and for all we know some event could be lurking around the corner that will add to inflation (eg worsening crisis with Russia, higher energy costs - who knows?).

I’m not predicting anything close to that, but the point is that if you would have locked in a long-term 5% in 1977 thinking that was going to be the high for the foreseeable future, you would have missed out on a lot of gains timing the market.

12mlwu2,Kashmir79,The Top 10 One-Fund Portfolios,"One of the more common questions on this sub is when a young new investor asks something like: “I just opened my first retirement account. What fund should I buy?” Experienced investors know this is a loaded question because fund selection is really the *end* of the multi-stage process of [financial planning](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Financial_planning), and in some ways the easiest part after you have done the work of articulating your goals, risk tolerance, timeline, and asset allocation. But the question doesn’t require a complicated answer because we also know that, somewhat ironically, fund selection doesn’t make a whole heckuva lot of difference when you are a young adult [as long as you can stick with it](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2016/07/whats-the-right-asset-allocation-for-young-investors/). That’s because, with 40+ years until retirement, almost any diversified index fund has about as good an expected return as any other, and your macro allocation (stocks vs bonds) [will be responsible for 94% of the variation in returns](https://medium.com/be-a-brilliant-writer/how-to-avoid-the-most-common-investing-mistake-the-little-book-of-common-sense-investing-by-john-1c2967acc68b#:~:text=94%25%20of%20the%20differences%20in%20portfolio%20returns%20is%20explained%20by%20asset%20allocation).

I believe it’s best for a new investor to just pick one fund and stick to it. It’s easy to get confused with all the options out there, to get bogged down in asset allocation analysis paralysis, and to construct complicated or arbitrary portfolios that will be obsessed over and later altered on impulse. Much better would be to pick a single good index fund and hold just that one fund in your account, thinking of it as your retirement fund. But the question remains - *what fund should a new investor buy*?

Here I took some popular funds and attempted to rank them for the best one-fund portfolios to use in a (non-taxable) retirement account:

**10. QQQ**  
This tech-heavy stock fund is the darling of many starry-eyed young investors who often mistakenly conflate the grand future prospects of revenue growth in the “innovation sector” with better stock returns (we know this isn’t necessarily the case [thanks to overvaluation and dilution](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/123)). QQQ is only 100 relatively volatile stocks, tilted to large cap growth, excluding financials, and only incorporating companies that trade on the NASDAQ - a fairly random screening if you ask me. Yes, you could do worse because, after all, it is an index fund and that is far better than stock picking. But given its inherent lack of broader diversification, its popularity is mostly just hype and [performance chasing](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/tech-allocations-in-your-investment-portfolio/). Whether this outperforms or underperforms the market in your timeline will come down to the luck of when you invest relative to its typical boom and bust cycles. Pro tip: don’t invest in a fund that spends marketing dollars from your expense ratio on [sponsoring college basketball tournaments](https://www.etftrends.com/innovative-etfs-channel/invesco-qqq-is-the-ncaas-official-etf-and-ready-for-march-madness/).

**9. SCHD**  
On the other end of the hype spectrum is the darling dividend fund, SCHD. [I wrote about](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/10fpn7j/schd_is_the_new_qqq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) how this fund is a lot like QQQ in terms of its popularity among novices, except that it’s style is dividend-payers (large cap value) instead of large cap growth. Once again, at least it’s an index fund and at least it tilts to a style with better expected returns, but it’s still just 100 US stocks which is pretty mediocre diversification given all the alternatives.

**8. VEGN**  
I figured any list of top ten funds for new investors ought to include at least one ESG fund since that is often desired by younger generations. I may be cynical about ESG, but I don’t think excluding the returns of some public companies from your portfolio and leaving those returns for other investors in the market to obtain (potentially at a lower cost) does much for the world, and many of these funds seem to be marketing gimmicks to prey on the good-minded. I also think that the screenings can be fairly arbitrary and may distract investors from focusing on doing actual, impactful good in the world, while making more money for the fund providers (who often use it to do *less* good). Even the most rigorous ESG funds still include numerous companies I don’t particularly care for so for this list I chose VEGN because, in addition to screening for fossil fuels, weapons, tobacco, child labor, and other typical exclusions in the ESG world, [it also screens for humane treatment of animals](https://veganetf.com/) (a cause near and dear to my heart) by excluding companies which use animal products including factory farming. What you are left with is half the S&P 500, 250 stocks, ending up tilted to growth, and seriously overweight in tech, communications, and financials. Like many vegan alternative products, it’s mainly just more expensive and unfulfilling.

**7. VOO/VFIAX**  
This the OG index fund tracking the S&P 500, recommended as a sole holding for the average American investor by both Jack Bogle and [Warren Buffet](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/03/billionaire-warren-buffett-swears-by-this-inexpensive-investing-strategy-that-anyone-can-try.html). It contains numerous blue chips stocks and household names which can give new investors confidence that their wagon is hitched to the stars of corporate America. I’ll quote [White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/150-portfolios-better-than-yours/#:~:text=Portfolio%201%3A%20The%20S%26P%20500%20Portfolio) because I like his take: “Don't laugh. I know a very successful two-physician couple who invest in nothing but this, are 7 years out of residency, and have a net worth in the $1-2 Million range. \[6 years later, I'm sure this couple is now financially independent as their plan has worked out spectacularly over those years.\] Their investment plan is working fine.  Every investment dollar, whether in a retirement account or a taxable account, goes into this single fund. It is simple, very low cost, diversified among 500 different companies, and has a long track record of exceptional returns.”

**6. VTI/VTSAX**  
Improving on the S&P 500 is a total US stock market fund. The returns are about the same, but you get the added diversification of small caps so why wouldn’t you take that instead? This is a favorite of [JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2011/06/14/what-we-own-and-why-we-own-it/) and [Mr Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/18/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market/) of the FIRE movement which gave birth to the phrase “VTSAX and chill”. For US-only investing, this is all you need.

**5. VT/VTWAX**  
This I would describe as the most “agnostic” of all the equities funds, and the one that most embodies the Boglehead ethos of buying the entire haystack, including global companies. Buy just this one fund in your account and [you own all the stonks](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1105756/vanguard-total-world-stock-etf-may-be-the-only-fund-you-need), at cap weight, and you get the returns of the total global market. Deviating from this weighting for equities implies you know better than the collective wisdom of all the investors in the market about how to best price and weight stocks, which is almost certainly not the case if you are brand new to investing.

**4. AVGE**  
What, owning all the stocks in the world isn’t good enough for you? Ok, well [howabout subscribing to](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/avge/) Fama-French informed, mean-variance optimized, and slightly US-biased global equities with Dimensional pedigree multi-factor screening from Avantis? If what I just wrote doesn’t make sense to you, this probably isn’t the fund for you because of its added cost, internal complexity, active management, and potential for tracking error. [Most people should probably stick with cap-weighted index investing](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/227) like VT/VTWAX. Personally, this is now the one fund I hold in my Roth IRA and I love it, but I didn't really understand factor investing until I was in my 40's.

**3. Target Date Fund**  
TDFs get a bad rep for being basic, but really what’s so basic about owning a 90/10 ratio of all the stocks and all the bonds in the world, automatically-balanced, with a professionally-designed bond glide path that is calibrated to your age, (hopefully) at a minimal cost? These are a phenomenal choice for anyone, and there is a reason that 80% of retirement plans offer one, and most of them serve as the qualified default investment alternative (QDIA) mandated by Congress for enrollees in new plans. JL Collins aptly calls them “[the simplest path to wealth of all](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/12/18/stocks-part-xv-target-retirement-funds-the-simplest-path-to-wealth-of-all/).”

**2. NTSX**  
Deviating from the Boglehead script a little more here, this is another “multi-asset” fund (including both stocks and bonds), but with a twist - [using a modest amount of leverage](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/), exclusively on the bonds side. It combines 90% S&P 500 - all the holdings in number 7 on this list - with 10% 6x leveraged treasury futures for an effective 90/60 allocation (or 1.5x 60/40). This should produce relatively the same volatility as a 100% stocks portfolio, but with lower downside thanks to the bond diversification, and thus overall higher long-term returns than the market (with exceptions being rare years like 2022 where stocks and bonds have a significant correlated decline). Futures contracts are a great way to obtain leverage because they don’t use overnight reset borrowing which is subject to “volatility decay”, and they minimize counterparty risk. Futures are even a great way to hold bonds in a taxable account because their yield is earned as a capital gain by being embedded in a contract as opposed to received as a taxable distribution. [This](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2018/09/03/leveraging-u-s-treasury-bonds-using-the-futures-market)[ may all sound a bit exotic but](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2018/09/03/leveraging-u-s-treasury-bonds-using-the-futures-market) “you would be forgiven for thinking U.S. Treasury futures are an obscure corner of finance. Surprisingly, they are the main event. Trading volume in them is the highest of any category of futures contract. Also, U.S. Treasury futures have been around for a long time, trading now for 41 years.” Wisdom Tree also offers developed markets (NTSI) and emerging markets (NTSE) versions of this construction which you could use to create a 3-fund portfolio, and RSSB is a more expensive global version set to launch soon. I hold NTSX/I/E at cap weighting in my taxable account.

**1. VASGX or AOA**  
Overall I think this is the best single fund any average investor can hold for an indefinite time period (including through retirement if they wish). These two are 80% global stocks 20% global bonds, or another option from Fidelity, FFNOX, is 85/15, giving you a [3-fund portoflio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/) all-in-one fund. That’s 10,000 stocks and 20,000 bonds, globally-diversified and automatically balanced, for just a 0.14% fee - possibly the most reliable passive wealth-producing instrument in the history of mankind. No matter what we think about how stocks or bonds will perform in the future, I firmly believe the portfolio of any new investor with a yet unestablished risk tolerance should include bonds [for a variety of reasons](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/in-defense-of-bonds/). 20% is a reasonably low amount for accumulation phase, but incidentally is also enough to give you [a relatively good safe withdrawal rate](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) even in retirement. [It is the preferred choice of retirement expert Mike Piper](https://obliviousinvestor.com/my-portfolio-updated/) and would be my first suggestion as well.

What do you think- did I miss the mark or leave something out? I’m planning to link to this whenever someone asks so please drop some knowledge in the comments.

“but the yields are so low!” maybe so, but stocks have not have a major sustained correction for a very long time. in the next 10 years, a measly 1.5% return could outperform stocks, as it would have in the ‘00-‘09 decade. are you ready for that possibility?

Kudos!

I thought I’d share a little background on my own connection to Bogleheads and invite others to do the same...

I started investing in my first 401k about 20 years ago and had no idea what I was buying - probably some crap active fund with the word “growth” in it which I mistakenly thought meant my investments would grow more, and a fixed-return product to satisfy my slight risk aversion. Thankfully, I had read [*The Millionaire Next Door*](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas-ebook/dp/B0BX7G7PZN) and knew I should try to save 15% of my income to be able to retire. I changed jobs around 2008 and I was mainly contributing to a government pension plus holding some kind of target date fund in my 401k which I thankfully ignored when the markets were collapsing during the Great Financial Crisis.

Fast forward to 2013 and I stumbled upon [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), read [*Your Money or Your Life*](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/12/18/your-money-or-your-life/), and became enchanted with the FIRE movement’s ethos of aggressive saving and investing to earn financial independence. I also managed to click early on into [JL Collins’ Stock Series](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) and [White Coat Investor’s 150 Portfolios](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/150-portfolios-better-than-yours/) list. [u/WCInvestor](https://www.reddit.com/user/WCInvestor/) attracted me to the Bogleheads’ forum where he was a [prolific contributor](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=735&sid=051592619b8a8d6be2e3b6c85f82af5e). As one of the vast share of lurkers on the forum, I perused the voluminous discussions which led me down the rabbit hole of reading and research where I emerged as a self-proclaimed Boglehead with a [Rick Ferri style 4-fund portfolio](https://core-4.com/classic-core-4-portfolio-allocations/) (3-funds plus REITs).

As a consequence of my ongoing interest in asset allocation and the work of others like u/rao-blackwell-ized at [optimizedportfolio.com](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/), [Ben Felix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXTQ8nWmx_EhZ2v-kp7QxA) with the r/RationalReminder [podcast](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast-directory), and lately Frank Vasquez at [Risk Parity Radio](https://www.riskparityradio.com/portfolios), over the last 4-5 years my allocation has evolved to include some more “advanced” strategies including factor tilts and modest use of leverage. But I stay true to the Boglehead method of using broadly diversified, low-cost total market index funds. And I still have the utmost respect for the simplest of portfolios, especially [Mike Piper’s VASGX & chill](https://obliviousinvestor.com/my-portfolio-updated/) \- that dude understands something crucial about [the value of simplicity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/mi8q4h/why_a_simple_passive_indexing_approach_great/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that many people with more elaborate allocations (including myself) maybe aren’t totally appreciating.

I am so glad this Reddit community was founded because I find the app-based interface much easier and more inviting to use than the forum. I have recently started trying to give back some of what I’ve learned from Bogleheads by occasionally sharing [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/zygwvp/2022_the_year_a_generation_of_bogleheads_learned/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [longer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/11prp0b/hysa_mmf_cds_tbills_searching_for_the_best_return/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/12mlwu2/the_top_10_onefund_portfolios/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to address common questions here.

10fpn7j,Kashmir79,SCHD is the new QQQ,"What do I mean by that? Obviously, SCHD is not a volatile growth fund of 100 tech stocks that only trade on NASDAQ. What I mean is that SCHD is one of the new favorite funds for novice investors, especially those prone to performance chasing. It is a leader in the trendy “must have” ETFs for waves of newbies getting allocation advice from (some reliable, some unreliable) YouTube talking heads. Many new portfolio reviews on r/investing, r/ETFs, r/Bogleheads, and r/portfolios may often still include QQQ, but it feels like much of its shine has worn off since last year’s -30% drop, whereas dividends are suddenly all the rage.

Dividend investing is sexy again, and it’s no surprise. This tends to happen when a bear market arrives as it’s the growth stocks that take the biggest haircut and so the herd turns back to income. While it was rare to see any portfolio review without a tech/growth tilt a year ago, today’s new investors seem to covet dividend income for reasons they can’t always explain. With [value outperforming growth by a whopping 30% last year](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2022&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTV&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=Vug&allocation2_2=100), and lower share prices inflating the percentage yield of the same nominal size distributions ([just like 2003 again](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/oct/12/columnists.guardiancolumnists1)), the performance-chasing crowds are loving what they see in the rearview mirror with top “divvy” funds. Not to mention, and stop me if you’ve heard this before, “SCHD has beaten the S&P 500 since inception” (i.e. just since 2011).

So what’s wrong with SCHD? Actually, not all *that* much. Sure, many of us have watched Ben Felix unapologetically explain how [dividend orientation is a misguided attempt to improve returns](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ). That’s because dividends themselves don’t *explain* returns, they are merely a *subset* of total return, and an indication of quality and value factors that you get exposure to with SCHD almost by accident. Dividend distributions get deducted from share price so it’s not like the dividends received are any net gain (aka it’s not “free money”). Nevertheless, SCHD remains a good low-cost, tax-efficient index fund that comprises 100 very stable and profitable large US companies, and which can probably be expected to outperform the market in the long run thanks to the naive factor tilts. Plus, as a value fund, it would be a serviceable diversifier to a growth-oriented fund like QQQ. Combine them and it’s like you are 2/5ths of the way to reconstructing the S&P 500. So as Ben Felix asks, “Why don't we just leave the dividend investors alone to enjoy their cash flows and their naive exposure to factors?”

Well, these are some things I might be concerned about when I see a new investor’s portfolio with a sizeable allocation to SCHD:

**Mediocre diversification**  

SCHD is just 100 large US companies- not a trivial amount, but not much by the standards of VT with nearly 10,000. Adding SCHD to a mostly US stock portfolio starts to really concentrate risk in fewer companies and overweights certain sectors which could create needless vulnerabilities. You are negating some amount of the benefit of (the compensated risk of) concentrating in value and profitability factors with the (uncompensated) risk of overweighting fewer large individual stocks and sectors.

**Illusion of safety**

Many investors also express a misconception that dividend stocks are “safe”, perhaps not looking back before SCHD’s 2011 inception date to a year like 2008 when another high-dividend fund VYM underperformed the market in a crash and [lost more than 50% of its value](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2007&firstMonth=10&endYear=2009&lastMonth=2&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VYM&allocation1_1=100). SCHD is still just mostly large cap stocks - all the same ones you can get in VTI - so when you see it held in combination with VTI or VOO, it’s often a missed opportunity for gaining more meaningful diversification like broad value, small cap value, international stocks, bonds for real safety, or preferred shares if you truly require income.

**Performance chasing**

An investor adding SCHD in the last year or so smacks of performance chasing. As I highlighted, the value premium has re-emerged in this current bear market and the herd (that maybe got burned by 33-66% losses in QQQ or Tesla or Bitcoin) is rushing towards what’s done well recently. SCHD in particular has outperformed even many other dividend funds over the last 2-3 years, perhaps thanks in part to concentration in particular industrial and consumer defensive stocks that have succeeded in the unusual pandemic economy. And while having a value tilt is generally not a bad idea (see [more lazy portfolios](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#More_lazy_portfolios) on BH wiki), a recent SCHD add is a signal that an investor may later change allocation again too late into whatever does well next - a classic way that individual investors underperform the funds they hold. It also means one may be woefully unprepared for whatever comes next because…

**”Fighting the last war”**

While a portfolio of VOO or QQQ or VUG and SCHD is reasonably diversified between US large growth and US large value, those are the last two stock styles that have done best in recent years. Meanwhile, [international stocks tend to outperform US in alternating decades](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cylical-outperformance.jpeg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1), are coming off their longest streak of underperformance in a century, and are valued almost 50% cheaper than US stocks so it could be their “turn”. This is especially true for emerging markets which have had their values beaten down by China concerns and the war in Ukraine, but which historically have higher long-term returns than US stocks. Plus, bond fund yields are approaching 5% for the first time since before the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Many newer investors have no memory of the “Lost Decade” of 2000-2009 when [dividends did you little good compared to bonds and emerging markets](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2009&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VDIGX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VBMFX&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=VEIEX&allocation3_3=100). One should be diversified across styles, sectors, markets, and asset classes so you are always holding the next winner as the market rotates.

**Dividend popularity cannibalizes yield**

Finally, few new dividend fund investors realize that overvaluation can reduce expected future returns in dividend stocks just like growth stocks. It’s not as pronounced as a growth stock bubble because increasing valuations for dividend and value stocks will move them outside of the funds' style screens, but consider [the following](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/201?format=amp):  

>“If dividend investors place a high value on the cash flow stream from dividend-paying stocks, they'll be willing to pay a premium for those cash flows above and beyond what a rational investor would. The result, if that is the case, would be higher prices and lower expected returns for dividend-paying stocks when yield is in high demand…    
>  
>The effect is more pronounced for stocks whose dividends are more stable or have increased in the recent past. \[Hartzmark and Solomon\] explain that dividends seeking investors are likely to buy dividend-paying stocks at the same time as each other. And this is important. They estimate that investors buying dividend-paying stocks during times of high demand have reduced their expected returns by roughly 2-4% per year.”

So SCHD is not the worst fund you can add to a portfolio but don’t think it’s definitively safer than other stocks, and don’t add it just because it’s done well lately. Performance chasing is hazardous, as is flocking to what everyone else is doing. Dividends aren’t expected to add extra return beyond what a value tilt can provide, and they aren’t an adequate substitute for diversifying into small stocks, international stocks, or bonds. That also goes for the popular DGRO, and especially trendy [covered call funds like JEPI or QYLD](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/jepi/) which should be thoroughly understood before one even *considers* them. As always, unless you are 100% certain whatever customized stock weighting you design for yourself is something you will stick with long-term and not flip-flop strategies if it underperforms, consider a simple, timeless total market fund like VT, enjoy your fair share of market returns, and remove your own individual assessments from the equation. Said of the [3-fund portfolio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/):  

>“The simplicity of the 3 Fund Portfolio is underrated. This simplicity in the use of total market index funds allows investors to not have to worry about choosing the correct asset styles and cap sizes, much less the correct sectors and individual stocks. Buying the market guarantees market returns. Using narrower funds with the goal of market outperformance (usually as a result of recency bias and performance chasing) creates complexity and the potential for market underperformance and subsequent uncertainty, dissonance, and tracking error regret, especially for novice investors. This can lead to abandoning one’s strategy altogether, usually at precisely the worst time. It is imperative that investors have strong conviction in their strategy in order to stay the course.”",215,0.86,116,Bogleheads,1/18/23 21:14,"what do i mean by that? obviously, schd is not a volatile growth fund of 100 tech stocks that only trade on nasdaq. what i mean is that schd is one of the new favorite funds for novice investors, especially those prone to performance chasing. it is a leader in the trendy “must have” etfs for waves of newbies getting allocation advice from (some reliable, some unreliable) youtube talking heads. many new portfolio reviews on r/investing, r/etfs, r/bogleheads, and r/portfolios may often still include qqq, but it feels like much of its shine has worn off since last year’s -30% drop, whereas dividends are suddenly all the rage.

dividend investing is sexy again, and it’s no surprise. this tends to happen when a bear market arrives as it’s the growth stocks that take the biggest haircut and so the herd turns back to income. while it was rare to see any portfolio review without a tech/growth tilt a year ago, today’s new investors seem to covet dividend income for reasons they can’t always explain. with [value outperforming growth by a whopping 30% last year](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timeperiod=4&startyear=2022&firstmonth=1&endyear=2022&lastmonth=12&calendaraligned=true&includeytd=false&initialamount=10000&annualoperation=0&annualadjustment=0&inflationadjusted=true&annualpercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalancetype=1&absolutedeviation=5.0&relativedeviation=25.0&leveragetype=0&leverageratio=0.0&debtamount=0&debtinterest=0.0&maintenancemargin=25.0&leveragedbenchmark=false&reinvestdividends=true&showyield=false&showfactors=false&factormodel=3&portfolionames=false&portfolioname1=portfolio+1&portfolioname2=portfolio+2&portfolioname3=portfolio+3&symbol1=vtv&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=vug&allocation2_2=100), and lower share prices inflating the percentage yield of the same nominal size distributions ([just like 2003 again](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/oct/12/columnists.guardiancolumnists1)), the performance-chasing crowds are loving what they see in the rearview mirror with top “divvy” funds. not to mention, and stop me if you’ve heard this before, “schd has beaten the s&p 500 since inception” (i.e. just since 2011).

so what’s wrong with schd? actually, not all *that* much. sure, many of us have watched ben felix unapologetically explain how [dividend orientation is a misguided attempt to improve returns](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinq). that’s because dividends themselves don’t *explain* returns, they are merely a *subset* of total return, and an indication of quality and value factors that you get exposure to with schd almost by accident. dividend distributions get deducted from share price so it’s not like the dividends received are any net gain (aka it’s not “free money”). nevertheless, schd remains a good low-cost, tax-efficient index fund that comprises 100 very stable and profitable large us companies, and which can probably be expected to outperform the market in the long run thanks to the naive factor tilts. plus, as a value fund, it would be a serviceable diversifier to a growth-oriented fund like qqq. combine them and it’s like you are 2/5ths of the way to reconstructing the s&p 500. so as ben felix asks, “why don't we just leave the dividend investors alone to enjoy their cash flows and their naive exposure to factors?”

well, these are some things i might be concerned about when i see a new investor’s portfolio with a sizeable allocation to schd:

**mediocre diversification**  

schd is just 100 large us companies- not a trivial amount, but not much by the standards of vt with nearly 10,000. adding schd to a mostly us stock portfolio starts to really concentrate risk in fewer companies and overweights certain sectors which could create needless vulnerabilities. you are negating some amount of the benefit of (the compensated risk of) concentrating in value and profitability factors with the (uncompensated) risk of overweighting fewer large individual stocks and sectors.

**illusion of safety**

many investors also express a misconception that dividend stocks are “safe”, perhaps not looking back before schd’s 2011 inception date to a year like 2008 when another high-dividend fund vym underperformed the market in a crash and [lost more than 50% of its value](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timeperiod=2&startyear=2007&firstmonth=10&endyear=2009&lastmonth=2&calendaraligned=true&includeytd=false&initialamount=10000&annualoperation=0&annualadjustment=0&inflationadjusted=true&annualpercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalancetype=1&absolutedeviation=5.0&relativedeviation=25.0&leveragetype=0&leverageratio=0.0&debtamount=0&debtinterest=0.0&maintenancemargin=25.0&leveragedbenchmark=false&reinvestdividends=true&showyield=false&showfactors=false&factormodel=3&portfolionames=false&portfolioname1=portfolio+1&portfolioname2=portfolio+2&portfolioname3=portfolio+3&symbol1=vym&allocation1_1=100). schd is still just mostly large cap stocks - all the same ones you can get in vti - so when you see it held in combination with vti or voo, it’s often a missed opportunity for gaining more meaningful diversification like broad value, small cap value, international stocks, bonds for real safety, or preferred shares if you truly require income.

**performance chasing**

an investor adding schd in the last year or so smacks of performance chasing. as i highlighted, the value premium has re-emerged in this current bear market and the herd (that maybe got burned by 33-66% losses in qqq or tesla or bitcoin) is rushing towards what’s done well recently. schd in particular has outperformed even many other dividend funds over the last 2-3 years, perhaps thanks in part to concentration in particular industrial and consumer defensive stocks that have succeeded in the unusual pandemic economy. and while having a value tilt is generally not a bad idea (see [more lazy portfolios](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/lazy_portfolios#more_lazy_portfolios) on bh wiki), a recent schd add is a signal that an investor may later change allocation again too late into whatever does well next - a classic way that individual investors underperform the funds they hold. it also means one may be woefully unprepared for whatever comes next because…

xbzs0w,JadocTheGreat,How fast can you get your money from I-Bonds when you need it?,"Edit at the bottom

I have been researching for moving some of my savings/emergency fund to I-bonds and think I have a solid grip on the 12 month lockout, interest, penalties within 5 years (if that is correct still?) and all that.

rwjdbp,Infinite-Tomato8120,I’ve inherited 6 million dollars. Help! I don’t want to screw this up.,"My father passed away last month and has left me and my sibling 6 million dollars each. About 33% is in SPY, with huge gains. 20% is in bonds (BND) and straight up cash. The rest is in individual stocks with many having large gains (nvidia, AMD, Apple, MSFT). 

I’d like to switch to a more boglehead approach, but I’m not sure how to go about it since most of the assets are individual stocks with high gains. How would you go about selling off the individual stocks and putting it back into ETFs?

I am 35 years old and am curious how feasible early retirement is with this windfall. I could easily live off of 120k or less yearly, which falls under 3%. Is that a safe amount to pull out every year, and would it be better to pull out 10k a month? And if that is a safe amount to be living off of every year, about how much more wiggle room do I have to donate to charity or friends every year, without digging into the principle? And How would you go about living off of the interest? Im assuming selling equities when they are on a good run, and selling bonds when stocks are down. I have no debts, I own a house and car, I live in California, and everything in the portfolio I inherited has long term gains. 

Overall, I’d like to grow this nest egg so that I can be even more charitable in the future. The most important thing is that I don’t start eating away at the principle.

126vhm8,ImpossibleZero,5 Y/O Marcus (GS) Account was Locked Last Week Because of Something I did over 2 Years ago...,"Today after 9 days of having my Marcus account locked, and them finally receiving my notarized affidavit of identity at their P.O. box... After [over 4 hours on the phone](https://imgur.com/d0RfhdT), a long email, and making a CFPB report, I finally have my answer of what went wrong. Can you guess what I did? Well before I reveal it, I need you to listen to a word from my sponsor... just kidding, Here is the answer: >!I updated my phone number.!< Yeah... Thats right, and I can pinpoint the day it happened from an email confirmation. On Feb 20, 2021, I updated my number and it didn't get flagged by their fraud department until March 21st, 2023. I have actively been using this phone number since then to gain access to the account then all of a sudden out of the blue, confusion, panic, and anger ensued.

Well the 21st started out like any other day. I have my own business, and I use Marcus as kind of a central hub account as it is easy to send large sums of money outbound from there. The day prior I had just sent out a large sum to pay for a new truck purchase at an auction, but then I got an email that would change my life for the next 9 days, but felt like forever.

""Action requested: Please call us back about your account"". I call in immediately and I'm informed my account is locked for fraud protection and they cannot tell me the reason until I am verified. I think oh no problem and I give them my last 4, DOB, passphrase, and the last step is a pin to my phone number. After several minutes of them sending me a pin multiple times, I just wasn't receiving it, and I'm thinking that is really odd. I ask if they can just email me a pin, but they said ""no, we need to verify through your phone."" I wasn't able to piece it together until now, but since my 'new' number (if you can call it that) was flagged as potential fraud, they were trying to send the pin to my dead phone number from 2 years ago and they for some dumb reason wouldn't or couldn't tell me that my phone number was flagged until after I verified my pin that was going to a dead phone number... yeah... makes a ton of sense.

They then transferred me to the fraud department, where when I finally got ahold of someone, they said they would call me back in 2 minutes for verification reasons where again they were trying to call a 2 year old dead phone number, but I didn't know that. So after 20 minutes of no call back I called again, and at this point I am starting to get frustrated, but on their side since I didn't take their call on my old dead phone number they have now brick walled me.

They are now telling me the only route to go is for them to mail me this affidavit of identity and get it notarized, then mail it back to their PO Box. Then I start to panic, because I know that will take over a week and I need access to my money, and I don't know the extent of this fraud or what is happening! Is someone intercepting my texts? Do I need to be worried about my other accounts? Future me here: ""Nope just the old phone number and a horrible fraud department"", but I am thinking the worst because they refuse to tell me what's going on. I tell them to let me upload my passport, DoD ID, drivers license, hell whatever they want!

Nope! Goldman Sachs doesn't have a customer email system, but don't worry I was told ""that is something they are working on""... yeah since when? the year 2000!?... No secure place to upload verification documents? I'm sure its coming any day now... so I beg them ""please just hop on a video call with me, I can sort this out in a matter of seconds""... ""sorry sir we can't do that""... ""can you at least priority mail me a pin to my address that has been on file for the last 5 years""... ""sorry sir we can't do that"".

The only thing they did allowed me to do is print the form instead of waiting for it to come in the mail, and I was able to send it off to the P.O. box they gave me. I asked ""when it gets there will you be able to unlock my account""... ""no sir, you will have to call in""... ""can you just call me?""... ""no sir, you will have to call in""...

So I rush to the notary before the end of business and mail this thing off, and then its time to wait... then call to check if they got it... 30 minutes on hold... explain everything, ""nope we didn't get it yet""... then wait a few more days... call... 30 minutes on hold... ""not yet..."", wait some more time and call... meanwhile I am checking my other accounts and everything looks good, but I have to scrap together some money that I didn't know I would need, and end up paying tons of fees and making tons of additional calls to sort out my business situation... and then finally after 9 days they got it... not to mention that I got their mailed AoI after only 3 days.

**TLDR:** So then today they tell me ""The reason your account was locked is because our verification service wasn't showing your name for the number you had on file""... I'm dumbfounded: ""Wait the one that has been utilized to log in to my account for the last 2 years?""... ""yes sir, so we referred to your prior number, but don't worry I put in a $4 request so you can get reimbursed for the notary fee and the inconvenience""

We left off with Marcus finally restoring access to my account and I had a pending 'goodwill' credit:

Well I got a call from their their customer care team to inform me of the status of that 'goodwill' credit and here is that recorded call for quality assurance: [https://vocaroo.com/1cc8rfW4yXjB](https://vocaroo.com/1cc8rfW4yXjB) (couldn't find a less cute audio upload website)

To summarize the call to those who don't want to hear me rambling on, they denied my measly requested $4 credit for notary reimbursement and denied any accountability for the entire debacle, and have zero intention of improving in any way.

q1xjls,I_Think_Naught,I checked Jack's math and I'm a little riled up about the results.,"In the Frontline video from this recent post

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pwo1i4/the_retirement_gamble

Mr. Bogle says that over 50 years a 2 percent per year fee on an account earning 7 percent per year will erode almost two thirds of the ending balance. That didn't sound right to me so I checked the math using an online calculator and confirmed the results.

Then I revised the calculation using plain old math and a typical 1.5 percent AUM type fee. Here are the numbers.

1.055^50 ÷ 1.07^50 = 0.49 or HALF.

Now you might say 7 percent is low but for 60/40 stocks/bonds and 40 percent of stocks in international I think 7 would be doing quite well. And 1.5 is a pretty typical fee when all the different layers are added up.

Then you might say 50 years is a long time but if someone starts accumulating at 35 and dies at 85 their assets have been under management for 50 years.

I have always been pretty ambivalent about financial advisors (edit: changed from planners) thinking some folks need these types of services. But HALF, they are going to take half your money!

Now I see why Mr. Bogle was so passionate about the tyranny of management fees.

I’m a 34 year old mechanical engineer. But I took a very non traditional path and didn’t graduate with that degree until I was 29. I have been at my current position in the midwest ever since. Was hired at 65k and in 5 years am now at 85k which I felt was good progress. Never saved long term until I got this job and now at 52k in my company Roth just from maxing company match and felt pretty good about that. I also have two kids, wife just started working again this year, and a mortgage, so there’s that. 

Then I start reading this sub and seeing the income numbers you guys are throwing around and I’m just completely flabbergasted! (That’s a polite way of putting it)

I can imagine myself at just over 100k/yr in the not too distant future. But high 100s? Multiple 100s?!? What kind of jobs are netting people younger than me these numbers? Are they all in HCOL areas and that’s a big part of it?

I would much rather be doing all kinds of other things, but I finally have a little financial cushion and I’m finally getting serious about setting myself up long term.

But the S&P reaching 100,000 is a very real possibility in the future based on historical returns.

To show the math, I am going to average out the S&P over 1980-83 as 120 (it was during a very volatile Bear market so stocks move around a lot) and I am going to average 2021-23 as 4500 for simplicity. 

From 120 to 4500 is a 37.5x increase without including any dividends. Now, lets take the current 4500 S&P and multiply that by the 37.5x price only return 40 years from now. 

Based on this math, this means that the S&P 500 (price only) will be at 168,750 in the year 2063. This is the long run we are going for, not the short term variations. Plus, that 168k is assuming 0 dividends. 

Of course, I need to add the caveats that nothing is guaranteed. Doing math linearly like this is flawed by its nature because of 40 years of unknowns. However, even a assuming the market only returns 60% of what it did in the last 40 years, that still puts the S&P in 2063 at 100,800 without dividends.

1355wxx,GardenaGeat,Is a CD Ladder the closest thing to a fixed-rate High Yield Savings Account?,"I have just over 80k in cash savings (not including 401k or Roth IRA) and currently have it sitting in an Ally savings account at 3.75% APY.

I'm not very familiar with CDs or CD ladders, just stumbled upon them recently, but did a compounding investment formula that matched out with CD calculators I found online, so it seems pretty straight-forward.

I found a CD ladder that goes for 5 years with an average APY of 4.67%. The APY for each CD in the ladder varies, but 4.67% compounding monthly with annual reinvestment of capital gains looks pretty attractive right now.

I'm not sure how much longer these 3% - 4% savings accounts are going to last, but for cash on hand that I may need in the future, might a CD with a locked rate be a good idea?

I understand that there can be penalties with early withdrawal (and I have to look into that more) but I also know that there are some penalty-free CDs out there as well too.

The market tends to average 6% - 7% in the long-run (and has had even larger returns after bear markets, just look at this year YTD so far) but that's the risk I'm willing to take in my 401k and Roth IRA, not so much my savings account.

But then I spent more time on Reddit and talked to some friends who did stock picking. I saw them gain a lot of money and I admit it tempted me to try it out. I also wanted to take a risk and hopefully get a better jump on paying off my student loans. This was foolish. 

I ended up losing money and am currently down over $1500 in my taxable account. If I just would have stuck to index funds, I would be fine. I now have less money to pay off my loans. And here's the kicker, I just found out my loans are due in March when I previously thought they were due in September! I timed the market poorly and I will likely have less money to pay off my loans (and the interest will grow). 

Anyway, the things I've learned: 

1) For every winner, there are many losers. Short term stock picking is very much like gambling. I knew this previously, but this was definitely internalized now. 

2) Beyond the money, it's just not worth the time and energy. I don't think people take this into account. Is beating the market worth being stressed out and losing time? I don't think it is. 

3) Be aware of FOMO. I thought I wasn't so susceptible to this, but I still fell prey to worrying about other people's gains. 

4) Sticking to your plan feels great. I was happy with my previous plan and would have been in a good position to pay off my loans.

wim4u9,Formal-Confusion8027,Taking foot off the gas after first 100K - can/should I do it?,"Hi all,

There's that quote from Charlie Munger about how you absolutely need to hustle for the first 100K and then afterwards you can take your foot off the gas a little.

I'm in my late 20s. My retirement savings (401K, Roth IRA, HSA) hit 100K last November, since then between the market and my contributions I'm basically still there. I've been lucky, my parents helped me with college so I didn't have loans and was able to start off with a pretty good savings rate, 19% when I started working. I've had raises and such since, I'm now at a 24% retirement savings rate, and I save 10% on top of that through ESPP that I immediately cash out and put into a savings account/taxable. My Roth and HSA are maxed out, my 401K is not. My employer also matches 5% for my 401K.

Some stuff has happened where I'm rethinking a bit. I don't regret saving this much except maybe I wish I had taken a few more vacations and said yes to some experiences that I said no to. Also other than the ESPP money, I don't really have down payment savings or anything.

They say you should save 15-20% for retirement and I'm doing that, you should start early and fortunately I was able to do that, and that the first 100K is the hardest and I'm there. I guess I just want someone smart and experienced to look at my situation and tell me ""yes, you can cut your 401K contributions by up to 4%"" or whether that is a bad idea. All the flowcharts say I should keep going til I'm maxing my 401K. However everything else says save 15-20%, and I'm kind of bummed about some of the things I didn't get to do.

Can someone older or wiser than me tell me whether they think I'm at the ""take your foot off the gas"" stage yet, or if I should wait a while longer? Thank you!",213,0.91,91,Bogleheads,8/7/22 14:13,"hi all,

13vo2l1,FinanceTAWAY1999,Anyone else has/had Financial Anxiety regarding... dating and marriage?,"Hi everyone!

For context I'm a 24M, currently with a NW of 65K. Ever since discovering FI/RE and the Bogleheads Philosophy, it has been my main goal to achieve FI and remove myself from the rat race. To that end, I live an extremely frugal life, cooking my own meals, rarely going out (I go out occasionally, but mostly enjoy gaming with my friends or watching shows at home to destress) etc. The current big goal now is to hit or surpass a NW of 100K by 25, and the end goal is to retire somewhere around 40 to an area with a LCOL + travel the world (My country can be classified HCOL, one of the most expensive in the world).

To that end, while I'm a decent looking guy with a good personality and sense of humour, everytime I think of dating or marriage, the thought of having to derail my financial plans (going on dates, expensive trips, gifts, weddings) puts me off to the fact. For example, my biggest hobby is travel, and I take 2-3 trips a year overseas on a shoestring budget (think living in Hostels, cheapest flights possible, only spending when necessary, things regular people are not used to when on holiday). Additionally, the stories of divorces wrecking one's financials doesn't inspire any confidence in me regarding the issue.

Human as I am, I do get lonely and/or think about being in a relationship, though dating apps currently fix that by providing the human interaction, and occassionally hookups. However, it's just that whenever I think about potentially entering into a relationship, all these thoughts of having to derail financial plans, change my frugal lifestyle, or having to consider someone else's life when migrating to a LCOL area to retire immediately turns me off to it. Financial Planning is just easier when only your life has to be considered.

Anyone else has had similar experiences/stories? Would love to hear some thoughts to provide myself some perspective, thank you!

m4xb1n,Fenderstratguy,The 5 stages of acceptance on becoming a Boglehead,"In a nod to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, I wanted to document my 5 stages of acceptance to becoming a Bogle believer. Sometimes the mistakes you make are your best teacher - because YOU always know better than anyone else. For those who don't buy the Boglehead philosophy, may your mistakes happen early enough in life that you can recover, see the light, and learn to invest the correct way.

Stage 1 - ""I'm great at picking stocks"". I remember getting into stocks in the 1990's courtesy of my mom. She did great and massed a nice portfolio through the years. So I tried to do what she did, but never as well. Dad and I finally figured out she must have a lucky horseshoe implanted somewhere because she would always come home from Vegas with more money that she left with - always. I gave up for 3 years when a stock I researched for 3 years and finally got FDA approval tanked - lost $35,000 - an expensive lesson.

Stage 2 - ""OK I can't pick individual stocks, but I can time the market"" So my work 401K had been setup in a target date fund 2035. After 10 years and doing yearly reviews I saw it was really taking off. So I like getting into the weeds, and although the TDF was getting 9-10% returns over the 10 years, my keen eye noted another fund we had a choice to invest in - this T Rowe Price healthcare fund had averaged 19% returns over the past 10 years - and someone at work was invested in this too! ""What genius is this?"" I though - so I ""researched"" for a month before moving 15% of my 401K into that fund. I also learned a lot about my 401K including expense ratios, only having 2 reallocations per month, etc. 

Stage 3 - ""OK there must be something to broad based fund investing"" OK I was on my way to a healthy retirement savings or so I thought with me at the helm firmly steering my 401K and investments into the best performing fund sectors (stupid me). Luckily I was still doing a lot of reading on the side including reading all the investment reddit forums, as well as listening to 10 audiobooks on the commute to work over 4 months. So thanks to the forums, Jack Bogle, and books (like The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, A Simple Path To Wealth, and The Psychology of Money) for acting like a light house and keeping my ship from wreaking. Thanks to this repetition, it finally sunk thru my thick skull that (1) you can't pick individual stock (2) you also cannot chase market beating returns by performance chasing even if cloaked as a sector ETF or index fund. Sorry Cathy Wood - I better sell that small chunk of ARKG that I bought.

Stage 4 - ""I'm a believer in the 3 fund portfolio ... but"" So it took me 4 months to get to this stage. I met with our 401K administrator, I was successful in having my employer's board of directors approve adding VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX to the funds available within our 401K. But like all type A do it yourself people, I needed to understand more. Asset allocation - how much in VTSAX vs VTIAX vs VTBLX? I went thru the ""maybe I can tilt towards small cap valve"" or ""disruptive technologies"" or ..... .  I ran 100 spread sheets looking at what to do after retirement, % of net worth on tax-advantaged accounts vs taxable accounts, impact on safe withdrawal rates, etc. Then factoring in social security, military retirement, etc. AT the end of the day it is simple - save as much as you can, spend less, keep investing as much as you can, don't try to time the market. As an aside I did get very lucky (for once) - I refi'd my house and got the rate locked in at 2.5% - and rates have been rising ever since. Perhaps a little of my mom's luck is rubbing off on me. 

Stage 5 - ""I have fully accepted the 3 fund portfolio, and have quit looking at my returns - frequently""  So this is the stage I am in now - I've even stopped looking frequently at my 401K balance (it used to be daily - then weekly. Now not so much). I'm even tweaked my spreadsheets so much there isn't any more tweaking left for my financial plan. I have now moved into the (thankfully) boring part of my financial life - keep buying my 3 low cost index funds every month, keep maxing our Roth IRA and 529 plan, put extra into Vanguard brokerage account, and look at rebalancing maybe every 6 months or when outside my preset bands.

rlisnq,Feisty-Ad3102,Motley Fool Stock Advisor Experiment,"Hi,

I've been following Motley Fool on and off since 2000.

I've been doing relatively well in the market over the years, but I made a major mistake at the March 2020 Covid crash.  I sold nearly everything early in the crash because I also thought everything was overvalued, and I thought this was the big one.  It did save me from the depths of the plunge, but then I missed the recovery.  I kept expecting it to plunge back down, as I couldn't understand how all these losses would not kill the market, and it didn't.

Anyway, long story short, by November 2020 I realized I had made a big mistake.  I joined StockAdvisor on Motley Fool at the time as well as Seeking Alpha and resolved to put a lot of effort and time into stock picking and buying and holding.

After a few months though, I got sick of Motley fool continuously pushing insanely overpriced stocks, with the standard answer that valuation doesn't really matter for good companies.  That makes no sense to me.  So let's assume the price of TSLA's stock tomorrow jumped up to $10K.  Would it still not matter?  How about $100k?

I did get a few good winners through Stock Advisor like CrowdStrike and Broadcom and Lam Research, but also quite a few duds like Lemonade.

I stopped buying any of their stocks about 6 months in but always wondered if they're right.

So I've done this experiment.  Not sure if anyone will find it interesting, but might be helpful if anyone is curious

Stock Advisor recommends two stocks a month.

It will also release two lists of 5 Best Buys now during the month.  One for team Tom, and the other team David (teams renamed now but can't be bothered to check what they're called)

So I've created two Test Portfolios.

1. StockAdvisor Recommendations:

In this one, I simulated putting $5000 in every stock recommended by StockAdvisor, at the closing price of the stock for the day.

&#x200B;

2) StockAdvisor Best Buys.

In this one simulated putting $1000 in each one of the best buys announced on the day it's announced.

I've captured all recommendations from Nov 2020 till Nov 2021 when my subscription ran out.

&#x200B;

**Results**

1. Stock Advisor Recommendations Portfolio.

As of today, it is down 10.95%.

It holds 21 different stocks.

This is what it looks like for the year compared to S&P

2) Stock Advisor Best Buys Portfolio

As of today, it is down 12.91%

It holds 53 different stocks

This is what it looks like for the year compared to S&P

**Conclusion**

I think this is a horrendous performance honestly.  I know the Fools will say, we're here for the long game etc, and in the short term the market will fluctuate, but I think this was pretty predictable given how overvalued and overhyped nearly all their recommendations are.

Yes they do come across some massive multi-baggers, but if you buy all they recommend equally, I don't think you'll beat market.  The numbers they share are since they started around 2000 , which is not a valid scenario for any of us.

Needless to say, I've become a boglehead. Sold a lot of my individual holdings and moved into index ETFs with a set allocation which I will rebalance twice yearly.

Kept a few of the big bets I had which I still believe in, but let's see how they do.

Hope this was interesting to someone 

**Edit**
I take on board all comments that 1 year is an unfair period of time.  Also my conclusion above may be overly harsh based on that.  I’m going to continue monitoring these two portfolios for years to see how they do.  Will post the updates here every year.  I think it’s a valid test as SA recommend you hold more than 15 of their stocks and both portfolios hold much more.",254,0.95,80,Bogleheads,12/21/21 11:52,"hi,

anyway, long story short, by november 2020 i realized i had made a big mistake.  i joined stockadvisor on motley fool at the time as well as seeking alpha and resolved to put a lot of effort and time into stock picking and buying and holding.

after a few months though, i got sick of motley fool continuously pushing insanely overpriced stocks, with the standard answer that valuation doesn't really matter for good companies.  that makes no sense to me.  so let's assume the price of tsla's stock tomorrow jumped up to $10k.  would it still not matter?  how about $100k?

i did get a few good winners through stock advisor like crowdstrike and broadcom and lam research, but also quite a few duds like lemonade.

i stopped buying any of their stocks about 6 months in but always wondered if they're right.

so i've done this experiment.  not sure if anyone will find it interesting, but might be helpful if anyone is curious

stock advisor recommends two stocks a month.

it will also release two lists of 5 best buys now during the month.  one for team tom, and the other team david (teams renamed now but can't be bothered to check what they're called)

so i've created two test portfolios.

1. stockadvisor recommendations:

in this one, i simulated putting $5000 in every stock recommended by stockadvisor, at the closing price of the stock for the day.

&#x200b;

2) stockadvisor best buys.

in this one simulated putting $1000 in each one of the best buys announced on the day it's announced.

i've captured all recommendations from nov 2020 till nov 2021 when my subscription ran out.

&#x200b;

**results**

1. stock advisor recommendations portfolio.

as of today, it is down 10.95%.

it holds 21 different stocks.

this is what it looks like for the year compared to s&p

2) stock advisor best buys portfolio

**conclusion**

i think this is a horrendous performance honestly.  i know the fools will say, we're here for the long game etc, and in the short term the market will fluctuate, but i think this was pretty predictable given how overvalued and overhyped nearly all their recommendations are.

yes they do come across some massive multi-baggers, but if you buy all they recommend equally, i don't think you'll beat market.  the numbers they share are since they started around 2000 , which is not a valid scenario for any of us.

needless to say, i've become a boglehead. sold a lot of my individual holdings and moved into index etfs with a set allocation which i will rebalance twice yearly.

kept a few of the big bets i had which i still believe in, but let's see how they do.

hope this was interesting to someone 

**edit**
i take on board all comments that 1 year is an unfair period of time.  also my conclusion above may be overly harsh based on that.  i’m going to continue monitoring these two portfolios for years to see how they do.  will post the updates here every year.  i think it’s a valid test as sa recommend you hold more than 15 of their stocks and both portfolios hold much more."

[https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/)

 

At global market weights, U.S. stocks only comprise about half of the  global stock market. International stocks don’t move in perfect  lockstep with U.S. stocks, offering a diversification benefit. If U.S.  stocks are declining, international stocks may be doing well, and vice  versa.

If you’re reading this, chances are you’re in the U.S. You  also probably overweight – or only have exposure to – U.S. stocks. This  is called *home country bias*. The U.S. is one single country out  of many in the world. By solely investing in one country’s stocks, the  portfolio becomes dangerously exposed to the potential detrimental  impact of that country’s political and economic risks. If you are  employed in the U.S., it’s likely that your human capital is highly  correlated with the latter. Holding stocks globally diversifies these  risks and thus mitigates their potential impact.

No single  country’s stock market consistently outperforms all the others in the  world. If one did, that outperformance would also lead to relative  overvaluation and a subsequent reversal. [Meb Faber](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ivy-portfolio/) found that if you look at the past 70 years, the U.S. stock market has outperformed foreign stocks by 1% per year, but ***all*** of that outperformance has come *after* 2009.

Excluding  stocks outside the U.S. means you’re missing out on leading companies  that happen to be based elsewhere. Similarly, there have been periods  where a global portfolio outperformed a U.S. portfolio. During the  period 1970 to 2008, an equity portfolio of 80% U.S. stocks and 20%  international stocks had higher general *and* risk-adjusted  returns than a 100% U.S. stock portfolio. Specifically, international  stocks outperformed the U.S. in the years 1986-1988, 1993, 1999,  2002-2007, 2012, and 2017.

Emerging Markets and international  small cap stocks have crushed the U.S. market historically, for example,  as they’re considered riskier, and investors are compensated for that  greater risk. And this is just talking about performance. The volatility  and risk reduction benefits are another conversation entirely, which is  of huge significance for a retiree.

Notice how U.S. or international outperformance tends to be cyclical:

If I were writing this in 2010 (or 1990, or 1980), we’d be talking  about how a global portfolio beat a U.S. portfolio the previous decade.  The important takeaway is that it’s impossible to know when the  performance pendulum will swing and for how long, much less how those  time periods would match up with your personal time horizon and  retirement date.

Moreover, U.S. stocks’ outperformance on average over the past half-century or so [has simply been due to increasing price multiples](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You), *not* an  improvement in business fundamentals. That is, U.S. companies did not  generate more profit than international companies; their stocks just got  more expensive. And remember what we know about expensiveness: cheap  stocks have greater expected returns and expensive stocks have lower  expected returns.

For U.S. investors, diversifying globally in  stocks is also a way to diversify currency risk and to hedge against a  weakening U.S. dollar, which has been gradually declining for decades.  International stocks tend to outperform U.S. stocks during periods when  the value of the U.S. dollar declines sharply, and U.S. stocks tend to  outperform international stocks during periods when the value of the  U.S. dollar rises. Just like with the stock market, it is impossible to  predict which way a particular currency will move next.

[Dalio and Bridgewater](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/)  maintain that global diversification in equities is going to become  increasingly important given the geopolitical climate, trade and capital  dynamics, and differences in monetary policy. They suggest that it is  now even less prudent to assume a preconceived bet that any single  country will be the clear winner in terms of stock market returns.

In short, geographic diversification in equities has huge potential upside and little downside for investors.

wa60if,Express-arnaud,My boglehead story,"Hi Bogleheads,

I just wanted to say thank you!

Until few months ago, I had a portfolio actively managed of about 50+ individual stocks, 20+ ETF, a dozen active funds, crypto, as well as self-managed real estate investments.

Lots of stress between managing tenants remotely, and all the market research for the trading. I created a stupidly complex estate with a dozen banks in various countries where I also had to manage overdrafts and currencies. Then income tax in each countries, etc. All that on top of a demanding fulltime job.

Overall, I was performing well (above market) which is probably what ""convinced"" me to keep going. But wellbeing cost was high and the reward little in regards to the time taken away from family and friends. I even lost weight due to the stress and lack of sleep.

Last christmas, my wife helped me accept that I was burning out. I sold everything brutally on the next day (including real estate which took a few months to close).

For the past 7 months, I DCAed daily (roughly 1%) all back into 1 unique ETF (Vanguard Life Strategy 80/20) and I'm finally done as of last week! I also invested in REITs (no cash, 100% fixed rate mortgage). I now have a simple and passive portfolio (in 1 unique bank).
All I need is to continue DCA monthly on paycheck day. I also took the opportunity to simplify and automate all our personal finances (bills, credit cards, subscriptions, etc) which feels really good too.

Once again, I want to thank this community for helping me realise that a simple boglehead portfolio will not only enable you to reach your FIRE goal, but most importantly it will also give you freedom and time back for what matters in life...",185,0.91,57,Bogleheads,7/28/22 6:14,"hi bogleheads,

for the past 7 months, i dcaed daily (roughly 1%) all back into 1 unique etf (vanguard life strategy 80/20) and i'm finally done as of last week! i also invested in reits (no cash, 100% fixed rate mortgage). i now have a simple and passive portfolio (in 1 unique bank).
all i need is to continue dca monthly on paycheck day. i also took the opportunity to simplify and automate all our personal finances (bills, credit cards, subscriptions, etc) which feels really good too.

once again, i want to thank this community for helping me realise that a simple boglehead portfolio will not only enable you to reach your fire goal, but most importantly it will also give you freedom and time back for what matters in life..."

How can I resist the temptation  to sell?

Since all of my investments are automated,  just stop listening to cnbc and fox business and not check my portfolio at all for an year  or two  ?

I said “oh gosh, I’m glad you told me, I was going to ask him to sign it to my son but of course I understand.” 

Well I got up to him and I guess he heard because he said “what is your son’s name?” And I said it’s Ethan but really, sir, you’ve done more than enough already.”

14jd8vw,Environmental-Pin848,Starting over in mid 40s,"So my wife and I were on a great path but life (and now death) has hit us hard. 42 year old male, wife 44, oldest child 22 and youngest 9. The oldest is living a great life and does not need any help but I would like to be there for him if needed.

My wife is terminally ill and is expected to have less than 6 months left to live. We found out nearly 3 years ago she had stage 4 lung cancer and have been unable to save and have actually depleted most of our savings with medical expenses and traveling to Atlanta often several times a week. It will be hard to go on without her but I will still have my life and the children and I need to make sure they are taken care of.

Thankfully we had money saved as it as come in handy these last 3 years and I do not regret one bit using that money to enjoy the last few years with her and the family. I mean what good is a retirement savings account if you aren't around for retirement so we also took a few trips for fun to make memories. I wouldn't change a thing and if we had more money I would have spent more but we made sure not to go into debt and only spent what we had saved.

we are in a VLCOL area of rural Georgia but we had saved, been frugal and have a nice house with less than 100K owed on it with a 3% rate. We have no car payments or CC bills. monthly expenses are low and we have been making it just fine and will continue but now its time to start planning for the future  for myself and our youngest child with roughly 60% less income.

She works for the local government and had a 401K that has no match but a really fantastic insurance plan and a pension. She was making around 44K a year and i make around 35K but have no benefits but thankfully a very flexible schedule which has been great on getting her to treatments. We had been banking on that pension for retirement and roughly 1M in retirement accounts by time we hit 65. Sadly she had not been there long enough to get the 10 years needed for vesting and there will be no pension payouts.

I still have some in a Roth and plan to get that back going once all this behind us and the youngest has a 529 with a little in there but nothing like you guys. There is some life insurance and after everyone gets the split I will have about 275K to get my life back on track. I do have 6 months worth of money in a HYSA for emergency use that we decided not to touch.

How would you go about, in a safe way, starting over with 275K in tax free money? I plan to max Roth moving forward and a good bit in the 529 but i need to grow this money in a steady way. Current plans are with my state 529 and Fidelity. i use a very simple Bogle method in my Roth of 3 funds 50/25/25 but open to change that ratio. I do not plan to change jobs and will be going to the marketplace for insurance once she passes and her plan is gone. At that point i will qualify for an HSA and will open one of those also.

I'm about to pay for a wedding and saving for a down payment on a house. 30k of this fund will probably go to the wedding but most of it still invested. 
Should I sell now and transfer what I need for the wedding to a hysa or should i wait until closer to the wedding date/when I'll need it to pay?
Also for saving for a house down payment. If I plan to buy in 2 years, should I plow into an index funds or a hysa for that fund?
I don't know how people save for weddings and house purchases while continuing to regularly invest. 
I'm glad to see the net worth growing every quarter but it's tough knowing that it's still far from enough to have the big wedding and 20% down for a 750k starter house (high cost of living area, Los Angeles). We are getting help for the down payment (100k worth of it!) But I still want to have 50-55k more to have that 20% down.

My income is roughly $79900/year after tax
My fiances income is roughly $54600/year after tax

15bvmpl,Due-Yam1632,I don’t understand the love for VT,"I genuinely don’t get it and I’m here seeking an honest answer not just trying to spark a debate.

My wife and I have a portfolio consisting of 90% VOO - 10% VXUS. We’re both 23 and I plan on keeping these 2 funds for a long time (until we’re close to retirement and incorporate fixed income securities).

I see the main justification being diversification. But between these two funds I’m already diversified over 8000 stocks (I know I’m not even evenly diversified across all 8000). And the added benefit from diversification drops so quickly after about 10 stocks.

I was close to going strictly VOO or VTI because they have consistently out performed VT by a significant margin. I’ve read the book I know that past performance doesn’t predict future outcome, but on the same side of the coin, US has outperformed international for decades!

So why not wait to see a true swing in returns where international has begun to out perform US and then make the pivot? Assuming the hypothetical “reign” of international stocks will be over a multi-decade period of time.

uztn8x,Dubs13151,The SP500 inflation-adjusted annual return is only 4.3% over the past 22 years.,"If you made a single large investment and had unfortunate timing (January 2000), your inflation-adjusted annual return of the sp500, including reinvested dividends, would only be 4.3% over the past 22 years. And after the first 13 years (January 2013), you would have still been in the red, not keeping up with inflation.

I often see the sentiment, ""just invest in stocks, you'll get a 10% return (or 7% inflation-adjusted)."" While this is may be the historical long-term average for the SP500, it's important to realize that your investment could still be in the red even a decade later. Some young investors take it for granted that the market always bounces back quickly, but it's important to realize that you need a long time horizon. Instead of, ""buy the dip"", maybe they should say, ""buy the dip and wait 20 years.""

To be fair, I've obviously cherry-picked bad timing. If you had been lucky to invest at the bottom, your returns would have beaten the average. It also helps if you had a steady income to continue investing incrementally over time, regardless of the level of the market.

The neat website below let's you run these simulations.
https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/

EDIT: I'm NOT at all suggesting to avoid stocks. I'm just saying that it's important to understand that when people say, ""expect 7% return"", there's a big ""plus or minus"" after it, which people forget to mention. If people understood this better, we'd see less posts saying, ""I inherited $100k that I want to use for a down payment in a few years, but now it's down 15%, what should I do?"" I would also pose that assuming a 7% inflation-adjusted return is too aggressive when making retirement plans, because there's a 50/50 chance you'll be below that average, and there's a realistic possibility of being far below it.

EDIT 2: Yes, it would be far more informative to simulate the much more common scenario of investing more every year (such as when saving for retirement) than just a lump sum. That would be a great future project. It takes more work and data mining, especially to go back ~100 years, so if anyone knows of this study already existing, please share. I'm sure it's been done before.

I started looking into investing during the pandemic. I pick and choose stocks that I think are good, I have done pretty decent so far.

nqvxpc,DoomsdayVivi,My little AMC anecdote to remind you to stay the course,"Hi all, I wanted to share a quick story with you about why being a Boglehead is the best strategy, unless you like relying on luck and irrationality (if you've found your way here, you probably don't).

I'm a public school teacher, so my primary retirement vehicle is my pension; the numbers involved aren't eye-popping but prove a simple point.

Back in January, I got caught up in the fever of WallStreetBets, and then moved about 5% of my Roth IRA ($1000) into AMC at about $16 a share. Things were going to the moon, it was so exciting--and then--RobinHood throttled folks buying. ""Oh no,"" I thought, ""this company doesn't actually have value, and if everyone else stops buying it'll collapse in no time."" Sure enough, the price dipped and I got out somewhat unscathed around $14 a share, losing less than $100.  Then the stock hung at around about $8 for a long while.

Now of course, you'll likely have noticed that AMC went berserk today, for absolutely no reason other than the irrationality of ""meme stocks"" surging all around and/or sticking it to shorts. If I had held, I'd have made myself a few thousand. But herein lies the problem:

1. How could anyone have predicted it would randomly spike now?
2. When it starts to spike, when do you sell? Knowing my relatively conservative nature I'd have sold at something like $20, and then just felt bad after it went way higher.
3. The price surging relies on others buying into the hype. I don't know about you, but I never want to have to rely on the reddit hivemind for financial growth.

Here's my main point and what's most relevant to this sub: Had I just bought $1000 worth of VTWAX, I'd have made $117 instead of losing $90. Trying to play the game, I lost myself $200 effectively. There's simply no way, especially in this scenario, to be smart--you have to just be lucky.

But there was actually a greater cost: my time and energy. I was checking Google Finance constantly to see what other people were doing with my meme stock. Why? Because it wasn't a good value buy. It was a game where everyone was trying to outsmart the other guy into holding the bag--and I want no part in that. If I had stuck to 100% VTWAX (I'm back there now, FWIW), I'd have saved myself time, energy, stress, and made $117.",288,0.87,161,Bogleheads,6/2/21 16:47,"hi all, i wanted to share a quick story with you about why being a boglehead is the best strategy, unless you like relying on luck and irrationality (if you've found your way here, you probably don't).

rsyhh6,Discoknox,Should I buy $50K of S&P 500 index fund while it's at a historic high?,"Hi, all.

I'm trying to decide whether to put an entire inheritance \[$50,000\] in an index fund. I'm new to investing and I would like to park the money in a safe fund with annualized returns at least of 7%-ish. If I did this, my plan would be to leave it there for at least 20 years. However, I'm nervous with the S&P 500 being at an all time high and with folks talking about an impending market correction in 2022. I am wondering if I should use the money for other things, wait to see if a market correction does happen, and then use dollar cost averaging \[since I will have used my inheritance for other stuff\] to buy the index fund.

If I waited to buy index fund, I would either pay off my student loans \[2.88% interest rate\] or use the money to pay for a down payment on a house and avoid having to pay any private mortgage insurance and lower my monthly mortgage payment.

For some context, I'm 41 years old and $50K is a lot of money to me. I have a remote job and earn $65K/year. I'm sort of couch surfing right now so I'm a bit eager to get my own place. My student loan balance is $27K and I don't have any other debt \[no medical debt, credit card debt, car loan, etc.\]. I'm single but I have a baby on the way with a due date in April 2022. I can get a comfortable home in my city for about $200-$225K. But I'm also okay renting until housing prices come down a bit. It seems like there's a housing supply issue at the moment and the ones available are flying off the market.

On Monday, July 19, financial markets hit instant replay.

[As fear spread](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-jitters-about-the-global-economy-are-rippling-through-markets-11626730635?mod=searchresults_pos1&page=1&mod=article_inline) that the Delta variant of Covid-19 might ravage the economy, U.S. stocks fell more than 2% at their lows. Crude oil sank 7.5%, its biggest daily loss in almost a year.

Airlines, oil and gas, cruise lines, hotels and shopping malls got pounded—just as they had in February and March 2020. Grocery stores, online retailers, pharmaceuticals, technology and personal-hygiene stocks went up or held steady; they fared relatively well during last year’s panic, too.

Past performance suddenly felt like a guarantee of future results—but investors should always remember that it isn’t.

How similar was this Monday to last year’s pandemic panic? Eight of the 20 worst decliners in the S&P 500 this time had been among those with the deepest losses last time. [United Airlines Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL) Inc., [UAL **-0.62%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL?mod=chiclets)down 5.5% this past Monday, had fallen 66.9% between Feb. 19 and March 23, 2020. [Oneok](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OKE) Inc., [OKE **-0.96%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OKE?mod=chiclets)the natural-gas company, fell 5.8% on Monday and 74.5% in the 2020 decline. [Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NCLH) Ltd. dropped 5.5% on Monday and 81.4% in last year’s Covid crash.

&#x200B;

Among the biggest gainers: [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/REGN) Inc., up 0.3% on Monday, after rising 13.7% in the 2020 crash; [Clorox](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLX) Co. , up 0.8% on July 19 and 3.2% in last year’s rout; and [Kroger](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR) Co. , up 4.3% on Monday and 5.2% in the 2020 slump.

Then, starting on Tuesday, as [corporate earnings announcements elbowed Covid aside](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-07-21-2021-11626853787?mod=hp_lead_pos1&mod=article_inline), the markets reversed. Many of Monday’s winners went down, and lots of losers rose. Now, in effect, the market was expecting the post-March 2020 recovery to happen all over again.

It was a wacky few days, and investors might be forgiven if they momentarily forgot that the past never repeats itself exactly.

It’s a tough habit to break: We live in a world in which skill and excellence often persist and price is generally a good signal of quality. Great athletes with a “[hot hand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hes-on-fire-what-nba-jams-hot-hand-reveals-about-the-power-of-streaks-11583256232?mod=article_inline)” seem to score again and again; your favorite restaurant’s food should be as tasty today as it was last month; a luxury car typically drives better than a cheap compact.

And there’s some truth to it in the markets, too. Stocks whose earnings and prices have recently been rising tend to [keep winning](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/ValMomEverywhere.pdf), while those that have lately been losers often keep losing.

But the stock market is a complex, dynamic system that doesn’t follow the rules of restaurants or cars. Investing is so competitive that history can rarely repeat for long; if any past pattern reliably recurred, so many people would pounce on it that it would soon stop working. Indeed, when the winners-keep-winning patterns reverse, they can [deliver devastating losses](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.3262&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

&#x200B;

The human habit of pretending that a rearview mirror is a crystal ball is almost incorrigible. Investors like seemingly coherent explanations of market moves, such as those the news media provides. As soon as the market stops going up, those explanations—no matter how arbitrary—[tend to make the new “down” world seem more likely to persist](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1988-01369-001).

Finance professor Meir Statman of Santa Clara University [analyzed](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v56.n2.2340) more than a decade’s worth of monthly surveys of individual investors. The proportion who expected stocks to go up over the coming six months rose, on average, by 1 percentage point with every percentage-point increase in the S&P 500’s returns for the prior month. It’s as if investors [believe the medium-term future is shaped by the short-term past](https://fac.comtech.depaul.edu/wdebondt/Publications/A_portrait.pdf).

Trying to get people to stop that behavior can backfire.

In [a new study](https://psyarxiv.com/c8pdw/) in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, behavioral scientists Peter Ayton and Leonardo Weiss-Cohen of the University of Leeds and Philip Newall of Central Queensland University tested disclaimers about past investment performance on 1,600 people in the U.S.

Roughly 1,000 had at least some investing experience. In 60 rounds of the experiment, the participants chose between “Fund A” and “Fund B.” Each time, they saw each fund’s fees and its gain or loss over the prior month. Those returns varied randomly—but, on average, Fund A would outperform over time, because its fees were much lower.

## 

Strikingly, when many investors viewed the standard mutual-fund disclaimer that “past performance does not guarantee future results,” they chose the fund with higher fees *more* often.

“A lot of experienced investors seem to believe that the warning won’t apply to them,” says Mr. Weiss-Cohen. “It’s maybe like they think, ‘I can make it work, because I know better.’”

The phrase “does not guarantee future results” may cause investors to conclude—erroneously—that past performance is nonetheless a highly reliable indicator, says Mr. Newall. ([Low fees](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/bespeneckbo/default/AFA611-Eckbo%20web%20site/AFA611-S8C-FamaFrench-LuckvSkill-JF10.pdf) are a much better indicator of future outcomes than [past returns](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.2867&rep=rep1&type=pdf) are.)

What does discourage investors from chasing historical returns, the researchers showed, is a warning: “Some people invest based on past performance, but funds with low fees have the highest future results.”

That apparently prompts investors to make a social comparison between themselves and others. Who wants to settle for investing like “some people”? Everybody wants to “get ahead of the Joneses,” says Mr. Newall.

So, as you watch the market on its latest wild goose chase after past performance, remember: Some people invest like that. You don’t have to.",134,0.97,38,Bogleheads,7/23/21 11:01,"i don't know if jason zweig has ever explicitly said he's a boglehead, but he's a boglehead.

n2czm9,BruceLeeTheDragon,Question about how I should handle my financial situation.,"I posted this in personal finance about awhile back, but I just found out about Bogleheads,  and wanted to seek advice here as well.

This is kind of long and embarrassing, but I would appreciate it, if any of you can give me some advice.

After highschool I didn't go to college and pretty much just wasted many years of my life. I worked a low paying job and literally lived paycheck to paycheck. Made enough to cover rent, some food, and drugs.
Next thing you know, I'm in my 30's and have nothing. I needed to change my life and thought the only way was through education.

I stupidly signed up for a private school that cost a lot. I was so desperate to change my life that I was willing to go to school for $80,000. I passed the entrance exam, so I thought I could do it. I talked to my dad, and he co signed the student loans and let me move back home if I stayed away from drugs. Great, now I can turn my life around.

So I got to the 3rd year and ended up failing 2 classes which got me kicked out of the program. I went to every free tutoring class offered and still failed. I owed $80,000 with no degree and I felt like such a loser. I got really depressed and felt like a burden to my mom and dad. I started to believe that if I wasn't around anymore, things would be better for my family.

My sister actually saw me, and stopped me. When I saw the look in her face I felt so ashamed and bad for how much I hurt her, then I thought about what it would do to my parents. If my sister didn't come home at that exact time that day, I wouldn't be here today.

With great support from my family, I went back to community college and graduated with a degree. I passed the state exam and got my license to work in a healthcare setting.

I started as per diem (basically on call worker), then part time, and for the past 2 years full time. I make $70,000 before taxes. Since I am living at home, I paid of my loans aggressively. I paid $74,000 in 3 years and still owe $6000.

Now I have $46,000 in my savings and $10,000 in my checking account. My work does not match 401k, so I thought the best thing to do is to start a target retirement fund at vanguard. I maxed out the $6,000 for the past 2 years, but is that the right decision? Is a target fund the same as an IRA account? What is the best way to make sure I have enough when I'm retired? I'm thinking real long term, not get rich in 10 years. What is the best use of my money? Should I invest in anything else?

Also, the thing that sucks is I'm 43 and still live at home. I felt good about graduating and paying off a lot of student loans, but lately I've been feeling like a loser again because of my living situation. I would like to own a house, but that's not possible in my state. Maybe I can get a townhome or condo for $400,000.

What should I do? Is it even smart for someone my age to own a home?  Rent in my area cost almost as much as a mortgage.



I just want to be prepared for what I have left of my life. I don't need to be rich, but it would help a lot to not have to financially struggle when I get older than I already am.

v1d8xf,BoxerRumbleEJ257,Unpopular Opinion: More People Should Use Target-Date Funds (TDFs),"The r/Bogleheads subreddit sees many threads where people are asking what fund they should invest in. Personally, I don't believe that Target Date Funds (TDFs) get nearly the recommendation that they deserve. This is especially pertinent to threads of young / newer investors.

Far too much weight is put on being able to have control, fees, etc., and not enough weight is placed on more important things like savings rate.

Investors in the US have experienced a massive bull-run with equities, and there are a lot of new investors who don't know that stocks don't just always go up. They've never really experienced a major drawdown, and may not have a real handle on their risk tolerance. For these new investors, a TDF that coincides with their reasonable expected retirement date is still going to be very aggressive (e.g., 90/10) according to historical recommendations (e.g., 75/25 rule, age in bonds, etc.). Even seasoned investors can benefit from a simple ""put money in and forget about it"" strategy where they're less likely to tinker due to recent performance.

**Fees**

With regard to fees, it is a Boglehead mantra that you want to limit the fees that you spend on your investments, as these are a fixed cost regardless of the performance of the fund.

My push towards TDFs is entirely based on access to low-cost index TDFs. **Index**\-based TDFs from reputable firms are typically well below a .20% ER fee (some firms offer actively-managed TDFs for a significantly higher fee, and this post does **NOT** advocate those). A few examples of current fee structures at some reputable firms are:

1. Vanguard: .08% ER
2. Fidelity: .12% ER
3. Schwab: .08% ER

When talking about fees, it's important to keep things in perspective. The 2022 annual cap (not including for catch-up contributions) for tax-advantaged space for most Americans is $26.5K ($20.5K for 401K + $6K for IRA). A TDF that carries an ER of .20% equates to $53 in annual fees if you maximize the contribution to your tax-advantaged account (obviously less if you're not contributing $26.5K annually). In most cases, the ER difference between individual funds and a TDF is far less, but I'm using that figure as an example in what I would consider to be a ""low-fee"" TDF (.20% or less).

For someone who is not considering a TDF as a result of the fees are too high, can they honestly suggest that they can't shave $5/mo out of their annual budget? Someone who is not contributing the annual max of their tax-advantaged account would be far better served figuring out a way to get an additional $5/mo into said accounts than worried about the fee difference.

Even if you're able to recreate the TDF asset allocation for cheaper with individual funds, human error / emotion in the asset allocation and rebalancing could completely wipe away any savings in fees you have. These funds take care of everything for you. The difference in fees between Vanguard TDF and their Mutual Fund equivalents is about .01-.02%, which is about $5/year.

**Investing In Bonds Too Early**

For many people, a TDF is a bad idea because it includes bonds / fixed income too early in your investment horizon.

According to [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/education/model-portfolio-allocation), the difference between historical returns of a 100% equities portfolio and an 80/20 portfolio is 1.2% annual. Extrapolating that to a 90/10 portfolio, we're talking about a .6% difference. Using the same math as before with the $26.5K annual tax-advantaged cap, we're talking about a difference of $160. Can someone who isn't maximizing their tax-advantaged space really say there is no way to cut out $15/mo out of their annual budget? Even someone maximizing their tax-advantaged space would be better off figuring out how to get $15/mo into their taxable account than worrying about the 10% bond allocation.

This doesn't even include the psychological impact of having bonds in the portfolio to dampen market volatility (the worst drawdown for an 80/20 portfolio was 35% vs 43% for 100% equities). Having one fund that you invest all your money into and don't think about the performance of the individual assets can reduce your ability to tinker in a panic situation (rebalancing between asset classes is handled for you).

**Too Much International Equity Allocation**

The majority of reputable TDFs are going to be weighed along the lines of global market cap weight (e.g., 55-65% US / 35-45% ex-US). For some people, this is too much ex-US exposure.

This all goes back to the US / ex-US argument, but the irony here is a lot of people often advocate for total market funds from the same companies who offer TDFs. They trust that company to make a US or ex-US ""total market"" fund by market cap, but don't trust them to allocate between the two globally?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TDFs Aren't Perfect**

This is not to say that TDFs are what everyone should invest in.

TDFs have flaws:

1. Fees: TDFs (or any AIO / fund-of-funds) are going to be more expensive than the funds that it is comprised of. Actively-managed TDFs are expensive (same as actively-managed Mutual Funds / ETFs), and are not ideal. In a situation where the TDF options are high-fee, going with individual funds is probably preferred (you can always utilize the ""portfolio as a whole"" method and use IRA / taxable space to develop your own total asset allocation).
2. At some point in your investing career, your portfolio balance (and complexity), annual contributions, and experience can put you in a situation where you may be able to manage the funds DIY and come out ahead. This is especially true for when withdrawing funds from your portfolio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

As a general rule of thumb, assuming you have access to a low-fee (.20% ER or lower) TDF in your tax-advantaged accounts, until you are maximizing your contributions and contributing a significant amount to your taxable account, you are likely better off focusing on your savings rate vs the fund that you are investing in; let professionals handle the asset allocation for you, and you just focus on getting more money in. You can always switch out from the TDF fund at a later date, but you can't go back and contribute to your tax-advantaged accounts for prior years.

At some point, if you decide your experience / situation justifies going with individual funds, by all means, go for it, but be aware that just because you can do better than a TDF, that doesn't mean that you will.",277,0.9,112,Bogleheads,5/30/22 19:56,"the r/bogleheads subreddit sees many threads where people are asking what fund they should invest in. personally, i don't believe that target date funds (tdfs) get nearly the recommendation that they deserve. this is especially pertinent to threads of young / newer investors.

m7cwnl,BobSanchez47,Young people should take risks with their investments - but the smart way,"Hello, fellow young people! 

We get a lot of advice saying that young people shouldn't be afraid to take risks with their portfolios. Why is this good advice, and how can you go wrong by taking it?

The basic answer is that taking a bigger risk entitles you to a greater average reward. There is a ""risk premium""; a risky investment should always have a higher average return than a safe investment. Thus, if you're willing to take some risks, you should do so and (potentially) reap the rewards.

This is both correct and incorrect. 

Why is this advice incorrect? Let's take a very simple example. Suppose I tell you that there are currently two companies, A and B, competing in the Gizmo market. As far as we can tell now, they're basically identical. But we know that the industry is so prone to monopolies that a year from now, one company will dominate the market completely, while the other will go bankrupt.

Clearly, investing in either company A or company B individually is pretty risky. You have a 50% chance of losing all your money!

On the other hand, there is a safer strategy: just invest half your money in company A and the other half in company B. In this case, you're guaranteed to hold the company which will eventually dominate the market, even though you'll lose the other half of your money along the way.

Which strategy has a higher average reward: investing only in company A, or splitting your money 50/50 between A and B? It turns out that mathematically, the two strategies have exactly the same mean return!

So if you decided to invest all your money in company A because it's a risky strategy and risky strategies get higher average rewards, you'd be making a serious logical error.

There are some kinds of risks that don't result in higher average returns. Any risk that you can avoid without lowering your average returns is a risk which doesn't compensate you with higher average returns. These risks include:

&#x200B;

1. The risk of buying an individual stock, preferring one company over its direct, equally-risky competitors
2. The risk of buying stocks in only one country, rather than across a range of equally-risky countries
3. The risk of trusting a money manager to beat an index, rather than investing in a range of equally-risky money managers
4. The risk of only buying stocks found on the NASDAQ exchange, rather than also purchasing their direct competitors on the NYSE (looking at you, QQQ)
5. The risk of buying companies in only one industry, rather than buying stocks in multiple equally-risky industries

On the other hand, there are risks that you can't eliminate through diversification without sacrificing average reward. For example, there is a systematic risk that stocks, as a whole, will do dramatically worse than US treasuries over the next 5 years. Stocks are systematically riskier than bonds. This fact is why stocks have higher average returns than bonds.

So how can young investors sensibly take risks? The first way would be to invest 100% in a diversified portfolio of stocks. Thankfully, Vanguard makes it really easy to achieve broad diversification throughout the whole world by purchasing a single ETF/mutual fund: VT/VTWAX.

If you want to go further than that, you can try to find parts of the stock market which are systematically riskier than the stock market as a whole, just as the stock market as a whole is systematically riskier than the combined stock-bond market, and begin overweighting these parts of your portfolio.

Some examples of riskier subsections of the market include emerging markets, small-cap stocks, and value stocks. There is significant evidence in the academic literature that these categories are systematically riskier than the market as a whole and receive, in the long term, higher average returns to compensate.

To summarize: there are good ways of taking risks (which lead to greater average returns), and there are bad ways of taking risks (stock picking, actively managed funds, etc).

Why should young people take risks?

First of all, many risks are mostly risks in the short term. A 10 year treasury bond is riskier in the short term than a 2 month bond because the 10 year bond can fluctuate more wildly in value when interest rates change. But over the course of 30 years, you're almost certainly better off with 10 year bonds than with 2 month bonds. Having a long-term time horizon means you can take advantage of this fact.

Secondly, having a long time horizon means the ""law of large numbers"" works in your favor. The longer the time horizon, the more important average returns are and the less important short-term variation is. 

Finally, young people have only invested a small fraction of the amount of money they will put into the markets over their entire lives. If you're going to invest $100 total in the market $1 at a time, it's not a very big risk to lose the 1st dollar entirely. It is a big risk to lose all $100 once everything is invested.

So take risks! But do so only in ways that actually benefit you on average. After all, if the market is willing to compensate you for some kinds of risk, why take risks that you get paid nothing for?",222,0.97,86,Bogleheads,3/17/21 18:49,"hello, fellow young people!

mhj4yz,BayBaeBenz,Why do I keep hearing about long term returns of 8%? Is that even realistic?,"I've read quite a bit about index investing so I'm not a complete noob, but there is something that I'm not so sure I understand.

A number that is thrown out a lot when talking about index investing seems to be the 7-8% return a year, especially when people explain the power of compound interest. But do you guys think this is even realistic? To me it seems completely off and people end up with way higher expectations than they should, am I wrong?

I am talking about index investing in the whole world market + emerging. 

For example [here](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/890dd84d-3750-4656-87f2-1229ed5a5d6e) are the returns of the MSCI World, MSCI Emerging and MSCI ACWI (which combines both I believe). You can see the last 21 years = 4.8% a year. And that doesn't even account for inflation. If you take that into account you would have returns of what? Like 3% ? That is magnitudes different than 8%....

I know past performance doesn't predict future performance, but wouldn't it be more reasonable to expect 3% returns rather than 8%?

I'm not saying that one should do stock picking or go full Nasdaq, or chase performance, I'm just thinking that people are expecting too much out of investing in the stock market in general. 

Again, this is not coming from someone who claims to be an expert. I am looking to understand what's going on. I actually hope to be wrong.

**The stock market faces a lost decade of zero returns through 2031, according to Stifel's chief equity strategist. Here's how investors should prepare.**

&#x200B;

* **Investing in stocks over the next decade is going to get tough for those that simply buy and hold.**
* **That's according to Stifel's chief equity strategist, Barry Bannister, who foresees a lost decade for stocks.**
* **Here's how investors should prepare for the potential of 0% returns in the US stock market through 2031, according to Bannister.**

 

The next decade won't be as easy as the last one was for investors in the US stock market, according to Stifel's chief equity strategist, Barry Bannister.

Instead of the [S&P 500's](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) compounded annual rate of return of more than 13% during the 2010's, investors should prepare for the likelihood of a lost decade ahead, or returns of 0% in the US stock market from the end of 2021 through the end of 2031, Bannister told Insider in an interview on Wednesday.

While that might sound crazy to the [millions of investors that discovered the stock market](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-investing-covid-pandemic-new-easy-apps-2020-9?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) for the first time amid the COVID-19 pandemic and were conditioned to expect new highs after every sell-off, it's not out of the question.

In fact, it just happened, relatively speaking, with the stock market delivering a compounded annual rate of return of -0.9% during the 2000's. That decade started at the peak of the dot-com bubble and ended near the depths of the Great Financial Crisis.

""Over two centuries, 20-year returns \[in the stock market\] have always been positive in both real and nominal terms...but over 10-years, you could lose money,"" Bannister said.  

Bannister's outlook for poor stock market returns ahead is driven by elevated valuation metrics, a local high in the percentage of stock ownership among households, as well as the potential for serious geopolitical risks. 

""As long as the laws of supply and demand exist, we're going to have \[supply chain\] disruptions, geopolitical rivalries, fiat currencies, indebted governments, populism, and \[profit\] margin and regulatory pressure,"" Bannister explained.

Some of this has already started to play out in 2022, with [Russia's attack against Ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/live-updates-russia-ukraine-crisis-2022-2?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) raising geopolitical tensions to new heights. The invasion has led to an exacerbation of supply chain disruptions and massive price rises in everything from [wheat](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/wheat-prices-today-limit-up-russia-ukraine-invasion-bread-basket-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) to [oil](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/oil-rallies-for-a-3rd-day-while-european-natural-gas-prices-trade-just-below-record-highs-after-russia-threatens-to-turn-off-the-taps/articleshow/90078264.cms?utm_source=flipboard&utm_medium=flipboard_rssfeed&utm_campaign=flipboard_referral) to [nickel](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/nickel-price-russia-ukraine-war-short-squeeze-lme-suspends-trading-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets).

""I would say that the locking up of Russian reserves was as big of a watershed moment as when Nixon got the US off the gold standard in 1971. This told the world that they need to find alternative reserve currencies for their assets.""

If Bannister's view is correct, that could strengthen foreign currencies like the Chinese yuan at the expense of the US dollar.

Geopolitical tensions could get even worse if China invades Taiwan, which Bannister believes is a given.

""Xi Jinping is not going to die without making a try \[for Taiwan\],"" Bannister said, noting that given his current age a move against Taiwan is likely to happen by the end of this decade. And on top of that, Iran is likely to resurface as a geopolitical hotspot in the 2020's, according to Bannister.

So how can investors eke out a positive return over the next decade? According to Bannister, simply buying and holding the S&P 500, a strategy that has done remarkably well since 2009, is not the answer.

***""Buy and hold is the ideal strategy in the bull phases...but in the down phases, being in the index is not going to generate a positive return. Investors who are passive are going to suffer,"" Bannister said.***

Instead, investors should allocate to real and alternative assets including commodities, real estate, and the more active long/short stock picking strategies often employed by hedge funds. Within the equity space, value stocks should outperform growth stocks, while international stocks are likely to outperform US stocks, according to Bannister.

In the short-term, Bannister admits there is room for upside in the S&P 500, with a potential relief rally to as high as 4,600. But those rallies [should be sold rather than bought,](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sell-relief-rally-prolonged-drop-stifel-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) because like in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, a 20% counter-trend rally in the market is possible amid a broader down-trend.",141,0.87,145,Bogleheads,3/21/22 8:38,"google links me to articles that they think i'm interested in. many of them are in regard to the market, fi/re, saving, etc. this one stood out to me today as a fun one to link for the bogleheads.

some of this has already started to play out in 2022, with [russia's attack against ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/live-updates-russia-ukraine-crisis-2022-2?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) raising geopolitical tensions to new heights. the invasion has led to an exacerbation of supply chain disruptions and massive price rises in everything from [wheat](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/wheat-prices-today-limit-up-russia-ukraine-invasion-bread-basket-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) to [oil](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/oil-rallies-for-a-3rd-day-while-european-natural-gas-prices-trade-just-below-record-highs-after-russia-threatens-to-turn-off-the-taps/articleshow/90078264.cms?utm_source=flipboard&utm_medium=flipboard_rssfeed&utm_campaign=flipboard_referral) to [nickel](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/nickel-price-russia-ukraine-war-short-squeeze-lme-suspends-trading-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets).

""i would say that the locking up of russian reserves was as big of a watershed moment as when nixon got the us off the gold standard in 1971. this told the world that they need to find alternative reserve currencies for their assets.""

if bannister's view is correct, that could strengthen foreign currencies like the chinese yuan at the expense of the us dollar.

geopolitical tensions could get even worse if china invades taiwan, which bannister believes is a given.

""xi jinping is not going to die without making a try \[for taiwan\],"" bannister said, noting that given his current age a move against taiwan is likely to happen by the end of this decade. and on top of that, iran is likely to resurface as a geopolitical hotspot in the 2020's, according to bannister.

so how can investors eke out a positive return over the next decade? according to bannister, simply buying and holding the s&p 500, a strategy that has done remarkably well since 2009, is not the answer.

***""buy and hold is the ideal strategy in the bull phases...but in the down phases, being in the index is not going to generate a positive return. investors who are passive are going to suffer,"" bannister said.***

instead, investors should allocate to real and alternative assets including commodities, real estate, and the more active long/short stock picking strategies often employed by hedge funds. within the equity space, value stocks should outperform growth stocks, while international stocks are likely to outperform us stocks, according to bannister.

in the short-term, bannister admits there is room for upside in the s&p 500, with a potential relief rally to as high as 4,600. but those rallies [should be sold rather than bought,](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sell-relief-rally-prolonged-drop-stifel-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) because like in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, a 20% counter-trend rally in the market is possible amid a broader down-trend."

I was only out of the market for a few minutes each time -- all of these funds track very closely. And now I have thousands of capital losses to offset future gains (lucky me LOL).

lcpam1,AzHP,Thank you post to my dad for telling me to max out my 401k contribution out of college,"I am 32 years old and have always been scared of investing. I chalk this up to my dad putting a $1k scholarship I earned in freshman year of high school into an investment portfolio only for it to lose $300 overnight (dot com). I like many others watched the GME debacle and wondered ""man, what if I was trading with my money? I could be making so much more money. But I'm scared."" 

So over the last two weeks i have been on a quest to better myself. I knew I didn't want to pick stocks. I read boglehead articles. I moved half of my considerable savings into a Vanguard account, closed my eyes and clicked on a target date fund. I kicked myself at night thinking, ""if you had done this when you first were employed, you would be rolling in money. you're so stupid.""

Except, I had done it. I just didn't realize it.

When I graduated at the tail end of the recession (2009), I asked my dad for advice on how to set up my w2 and he told me to put as much as I could into my 401k. My salary was low because of the recession, but it was respectable. I kept this allocation the same across the several jobs I've had since then. My salary has tripled and I have a lovely wife who just finished her doctorate a few years ago and also puts the max into her 401k. 

When I logged into my Mint account that I set up after getting my first job, for the first time in a few years, and actually looked at my portfolio, I was shocked to see how much money was in our 401k. It was 5x the money I had just moved into my new brokerage account. It is 3x my annual salary.

So even though I regret not investing into taxable accounts earlier, and not setting up a roth back then, or even a backdoor roth like my dad told me I should, I realized: I HAVE been investing all this time.

p18h0u,AzHP,12 years of accidental boglehead: a victory lap,"Today I logged into Mint and noticed I had hit two milestones at the same time: My personal 401k has reached $400k, and total assets (including wife's retirement plan) had reached $700k. Looking at the trend graph on mint made me appreciate how far I've come, from an empty bank account in August 2009 when I had just turned 21, having just graduated from college smack dab in the middle of the worst recession in recent memory, having no idea what a 401k was except that my dad told me ""put 15% in and pretend the money never existed"" (I had no idea what funds to allocate into so I just put an equal percent into every fund my provider offered, LOL) all the way until the beginning of this year, when I realized I needed to actually understand finances and investing after the GME and Dogecoin runups where I felt FOMO from never having consciously invested before. That feeling eventually brought me to bogleheads, where I am now the happy owner of a target date fund in my 401k, VTSAX and VTIAX in my brand new Roth IRA account, and AVUV and AVDV in a small taxable account.

I know I'm young compared to some of the other investors here, and 12 years is just a blip as far as historical trends, but I'm putting this here to let others know that you can have absolutely no knowledge of finances, not even realize you have an investment account, never pick a single stock, never read a company earnings report, never know if the stock market is up or down, and over time be laying down the foundation for a future of financial independence.

P.S. Ignore the blip in the middle of the graph, I moved jobs and never added that other job's 401k account to Mint, so it looks like my money disappeared for a few years lol. The blip near the end of the graph I think is when I moved a bunch of money from my bank to Vanguard on the last day of the month and so that money got double counted.

-allow him time to grieve. It’s okay to park the money somewhere for a year before doing anything

-advisors can be a scam

-investing isnt as challenging as I thought

-get even better advice from the wiki and the website (I still need to make an account)

-fidelity or vanguard accounts are solid options (havent decided which, but definitely not Edwards? Everyone seems to hate them)

-money grows more than expected, compound interest can be our friend, set it and forget it is the way to go

-index funds that are diversified: VT, VTSAX (US) or VTWAX (for diverse international portfolio) 

-ROTH IRA contributions are a good idea

pjxu6t,AlphaTerminal,PAY ATTENTION TO FEES,"I know this is a major tenet of _Bogleheadianism_ but it bears repeating.

Recently I started paying more attention to fees in discussions and am horrified.

Two examples:

- A friend is being offered active management of investments at 0.9% which is 30x more than e.g. Vanguard VTI costs
- I'm inheriting an IRA (about 90% equities) that languished at American Funds in a ""set it and forget it"" manner and discovered the ""professionally managed"" fund allocation there charges an overall average 0.63% fee and the weighted average 10 year return from this ""professional allocation"" is just 11.04% compared to VTI at 14.7% which means the IRA is both charging **20x more than VTI and underperforming by nearly 4%**

Take a look at this mutual fund fee calculator and run some scenarios yourself: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/mutual-fund-calculator

Example: a $500k portfolio with a 10 year horizon and 11% return at 0.63% expense ratio will cost almost $79k in fees and end up with post-fee net value of $1.34M.

Meanwhile the exact same portfolio in VTI at 14.7% and 0.03% ER costs only $5k in fees with a net value of $1.965M.

md8der,9c6,Why do stonks go up? A primer,"# Hello reddit boglehead noobs

If you are just starting out your investing journey, congratulations! We're happy you're here.

I often see this question from my friends IRL, so I thought I'd share a quick primer on why exactly do we invest in stocks? Why not gold, or bitcoin, or oil? Why not just hide it under the mattress? What about stocks make them an *investment* rather than a mere vehicle for *speculation*?

I promise there will be pictures.

By owning an index fund like VTWAX, you are buying a small slice of ownership of thousands of companies, all over the world. These companies have revenues, expenses, and profits. By owning a company's stock, you hold a stake of ownership in that company, and you do so because you expect to benefit from the profits. Companies reward investors with their profits through dividend payments and share price growth.

Many of my friends admit they realize the market is always unpredictable, but I cannot tell you how many times I’ve had the following exchange:

Friend:  9c6, what is your outlook on the market?

Me:  No one can predict the market and any guess I have would be just that, a guess, and the same odds as a coin flip.  Therefore you shouldn’t value my prediction.

Friend:  I know I know………but what do you think?

My thoughts are that over the very long haul, the return of the stock market is driven by a fairly simple equation, starting dividend yield + earnings per share growth +/- change in the earnings multiple.  The earnings multiple is commonly referred to as the p/e ratio.

# Fundamental Return = Earnings Growth + Dividend Yield

**Part 1: Dividend Yield**  
If your stock distributes 2% in dividends each year, then you will have a 2% contribution towards of return. This is what dividend investors love to see coming in each quarter, and is relatively easy to track for a large group of companies. Here it is over time for the S&P 500.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c7d8jh2wj8p61.gif

&#x200B;

**Part 2: Earnings Growth**  
If earnings stay constant, then all other things equal, one would expect the share price of your company to stay constant as well. If the earnings grow by 5% every year, then your share price will grow by 5% per year. Thus, earnings growth rate is a vital component of total return.

If your portfolio was all of the stocks traded in the United States, like that of a broad-based index fund, this would create a connection between the growth rate of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product and the earnings growth rates of all US companies. In other words, the fundamental return is based on GDP growth. In turn, the GDP growth rate is connected to population growth and productivity per person.

These two parts added to together are coined the fundamental return.

Some bad news: Now, from 1950-2000, fundamental returns were 10%: 4% dividend yield and a 6% earnings growth rate. These days, the S&P 500 has a dividend yield of only about 2%. Earnings growth rate estimates are subject to debate, but they hover around 5-6%.

**Part 3: Changes in P/E Ratio**

But that's not the whole story, as we should know by looking at the stock market. Why don't stock prices simply reflect the fundamentals? The answer is the speculative component.

  
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the price per share divided by earnings per share. In other words, it is how much investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings. If they are willing to pay 20 times annual earnings, the share price of the stock will be twice as high as if they only paid 10 times earnings. This part is denoted the **speculative return**, as it has changed throughout history. Here it is again for the S&P 500:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1h3fm9bxm8p61.gif

# 

In 1950, the P/E ratio was less than 10. During the dot-com bubble, the P/E ratio was over 40. In 2008, it was over 25. In mid-2010, it was 20. Today, it's around 35. The historical average is around 15. This will lead to a zero, and quite possible *negative*, future speculative return!

# Total Stock Returns = Fundamental + Speculative Returns

The below table is from John Bogle’s book “The Clash of the Cultures:  Investment vs. Speculation”.  Bogle refers to the change in the p/e ratio as the speculative return.  What you see on the far right column is that over the full period earnings growth and dividends contributed 9.50% of the annual 9.60% return, while the change in the p/e ratio only contributed 0.10%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6qkn1g0hh8p61.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5cffc0d5b2b6e9894c3ddc072f323428ccd9e7e

The 40s had the largest combination of earnings growth + dividends of any decade, but there were 3 other decades with higher total returns.  You can imagine that coming out of The Great Depression, there was a whole generation of people who had shun stocks for the rest of their lives, and the speculative return was largely negative.

It’s fascinating that earnings growth in the 2000s decade was 11.30% better annually than the earnings growth in the 1930s, and the market return during the decade of the 2000s was worse than the decade of the Great Depression!

Over the course of a lifetime, I would not anticipate the speculative change of the earnings multiple to add or subtract much from returns.  If you’re trying to predict the next 30 years from here I would guesstimate about 7% a year from the market.  The current dividend yield is about 2%, and if earnings grow at the historical rate of 5% you’ll add those together for 7%.  But as you can see, the formula doesn’t work very well in the short run.

## Summary

When predicting future returns, you have to look at all the sources of those expected returns. Fundamental return is still a solid reason why stock prices will go up on the long-term, especially if you are not investing only in one country or economy. Some people call it a belief in capitalism, that economic growth will continue and GDP will continue to increase. I simply believe in the passion and motivation of all the people out there, from Sweden to China to Brazil. However, there is good evidence that you might not be getting 10% historical returns due to P/E ratio contraction.

What does the future hold for returns? It's anyone's guess. Here's the picture from Bogle's book:

Nobody knows the future, but if you're investing for the long haul, you're better served by ignoring the noise, the news, the crystal balls. Hitch your boat to the global economy and a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. In the long run, the speculative component is a wash, and you'll reap the benefits of the passion and ingenuity of businesses the world over.

san3w0,9c6,Should you be investing at all?,"Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn’t be directing more people to r/personalfinance and [the flowchart](https://m.imgur.com/lSoUQr2) rather than giving investing advice about fund selection and how to weather stock market turbulence on this sub.

When I see people get nervous over relatively small stock market losses after such long huge runups, I can’t help but wonder if they’re bearing too much risk by investing after tax money they need for future spending in taxable brokerage accounts.

It’s moot whether or not you should be buying index fund ETFs, single stocks, dividend stocks, options, or crypto, if you really shouldn’t be investing those dollars at all, possibly not even in bonds. 

Some posters in the sub should sell their entire investment accounts and build their emergency funds and start contributing to their workplace retirement plan and a roth IRA.

And most people would be best served by a simple target date fund rather than learning much about investing, if it saves them from behavioral pitfalls.

If you’ve never seen the flowchart above, read it and follow it before you invest.

rddnr4,9c6,100% stocks vs human nature,"> “Short-term risk, occurring over periods of less than several years, is what we feel in our guts as we follow the market from day to day, and month to month. It is what gives investors sleepless nights. More importantly, it is what causes investors to bail out of stocks after a bad run, usually at the bottom. And yet, in the long-term, it is of trivial importance. After all, if you can obtain high long-term returns, what does it matter if you have lost and regained 50% or 80% of your principal along the way?


> This, of course, is easier said than done. Even the most disciplined of investors exited the markets in the 1930s, never to return. Obsession with the short-term returns ingrained in human nature; the impulse is impossible to ignore. Your short-term investing emotions must be recognized and dealt with on their own terms. It is an easy thing to look at the above data and convince yourself that you will be able to stay the course through the tough times.


> But actually doing it is an entirely different affair. Examining historical returns and imagining losing 50% or 80% of your capital is like practicing an airplane crash in a simulator. Trust me, there is a big difference between how you’ll behave in the simulator and how you’ll perform during the real thing. During bull markets, everyone believes that they’re committed to stocks for the long term. Unfortunately, history also tells us that during bear markets, it’s hard even to give stocks away; most investors are simply not capable of withstanding the vicissitudes of an all-stock investment strategy.”

w25bgh,710kidd,Just finished college and now make $50k-$70k (depending on performance) with ~ $150k in student loans to pay. Should I focus on pay the loans off or investing? Or both?,I’ve thought about this for a while and I’m leaning towards putting some money aside for both each paycheck which is biweekly. I can’t decide what how much I should focus on starting my 401k and maxing out the employee match because I really want to take advantage of this but also I don’t want to let my loans to get out of hand or hang over my head for too long.

I've read through the windfall wiki and thankfully I had the ""basics"" mentioned there (healthy emergency fund, good insurance, trusted CPA, complete estate plan) covered prior to this inheritance. 

I'm 45, have no debt and no kids. I max my 401k each year, contribute the max to my IRA annually, and invest half my take-home salary in index funds in my taxable brokerage. I live in a VHCOL area so am not rich compared to others in my orbit, but I feel I am on the right track to be comfortable and secure.  

So now what? Do i dollar cost average this lump sum into my existing index funds over the next X months (if so, how many months)? Do I actually spend some of it (I am much more of a saver usually)?
